# Fine Tuning Gluu Server
Gluu Server has a stateless architecture, it scales quite easy. However
to get high-performant server it must be tuned accordingly.

Tuning consists of:

- LDAP Server (OpenDJ, OpenLDAP)
- Web Application Container (Tomcat, Jetty, JBoss)
- Gluu Server configuration Tuning
## LDAP Server

(For convenience all samples stick to OpenDJ however general recommendations are the same for other LDAP Servers)

1. Maximum number of allowed connections<br/>If there are not enough connections to serve the client, a connection is
put "on hold" and waits. To avoid delays it's recommended to provide
expected maximum allowed connections.<br/>
 ```
 max-allowed-client-connections=1000
 ```
2. Provide enough resources to LDAP Server<br/> For example OpenDJ use JVM for running, for high performance it's
    recommended to give enough memory via JVM system properties.
3. Allow LDAP Server use cache as much as possible.
```
dsconfig -n set-backend-prop --backend-name userRoot --set db-cache-percent:50
```

## Apache Tomcat

1. Set maximum for parallel requests.
<br/>Connector parameters in `server.xml`:<br/>
    - maxThreads="10000"
    - maxConnections="10000"
2. Set memory settings via JAVA_OPTS<br/>
 ```
 set "JAVA_OPTS=-Xms1456m -Xmx7512m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -XX:+DisableExplicitGC"
 ```
3. Operating time<br/>
Check via Tomcat monitor whether requests are handled or just "hangs"
because there are not enough resources. Here is sample when processing
time increase due to lack of resources:

## Gluu Server

- oxauth-ldap.properties - Increase ldap connection pool size
```
     maxconnections: 1000
```
## Gluu Server Benchmark

Benchmarking based on Authentication Implicit Flow: http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ImplicitFlowAuth

Measures were made on single machine with Gluu Server, LDAP Server and test runner (clients). Therefore here is quite <b>subjective</b> results

|Invocations|Parallel Threads|Time|Comments|
|-----------|----------------|----|--------|
|100	    |100	|8 seconds|	   |
|1000	    |100	|	  |	   |
|1000	    |200	|	|Not representable: CPU 100%|
|2000	    |100	|       |Not representable: CPU 100%|
|2000	    |200	|       |Not representable: CPU 100%|
|10000	    |300	|       |Not representable: CPU 100%|
|100000	    |300	|       |Not representable: CPU 100%|
