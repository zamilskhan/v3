# Overview
[OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect) ("Connect") is a standard
profile of OAuth2 which defines a protocol to enable a website or mobile
application to send a person to a domain for authentication and required
attributes (e.g. email address, first name, last name, etc.). OpenID Connect
also provides some of the plumbing around authentication to automate how
this happens. If a person is visiting a website for the first time, the
process that OpenID Connect defines is 100% bootstrapable by the
website. This is really critical for Internet scalability. To visit
someone's website, or to send someone an email, you do not need to get
the system administrators involved. Connect provides the same type of
scalable infrastructure for authentication and authorization, and promises to define a base level domain
identification.

## OpenID Connect Implicit Flows
This flow is used only for user-agent based clients--primarily JavaScript--where you cannot hide a client secret, so client authentication makes no sense. The main difference between the OAuth and OpenID Connect implicit flows is the use of the *id_token*, which provides extra contextual information about the subject and authentication event. Properly validated, the *id_token* also adds additional security to the transaction. For example, the *nonce* can be verified, and the *at_hash* can be used to check the integrity of the returned token. For more information, read the [OpenID Connect Implicit Client Implementer's guide](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connectimplicit-1_0.html).

## OpenID Connect Authorization Code Flows
The OpenID Connect Authorization Code Flow specifies how the relying party interacts with the OpenID Provider based on use of the OAuth 2.0 authorization grant. The authorization code flow is more secure than the implicit flow because the tokens are never exposed to the web browser and because the client is authenticated. As with the implicit flow, the id_token should be validated and adds extra security over an OAuth2 code flow.

## OpenID Connect Hybrid Flows 
Hybrid flow is one of the least understood Connect features, but it's really not that bad. The `response_type` for hybrid flow always includes code, plus either token, `id_token`, or both. The hybrid flow can be used to achieve higher security levels--by returning the `id_token` from the authorization endpoint, the client can verify the integrity of the code by verifying the `id_token` claim `c_hash`. The most logical hybrid flow `response_type` is `code id_token`. You can also get back and access token from the authorization endpoint in the hybrid flow.

## Discovery 

The first thing you want to know about any OAuth2 API is where are the
endpoints (i.e. what are the uris where you call the APIs).
OpenID Connect provides a very simple mechanism to accomplish this: 
[OpenID Connect Discovery](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html).

In order for an OpenID Connect Relying Party to utilize OpenID Connect
services for an End-User, the RP needs to know where the OpenID Provider is.
OpenID Connect uses WebFinger [WebFinger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebFinger)
to locate the OpenID Provider for an End-User.

Once the OpenID Provider has been identified, the configuration information
for the OP is retrieved from a well-known location as a JSON document,
including its OAuth 2.0 endpoint locations.

If you want to try a discovery request, you can make the following
WebFinger request to discover the Issuer location:

```
GET /.well-known/webfinger?resource=https%3A%2F%2Fidp.gluu.org&rel=http%3A%2F%2Fopenid.net%2Fspecs%2Fconnect%2F1.0%2Fissuer HTTP/1.1
Host: idp.gluu.org

HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/jrd+json

{
    "subject": "https://idp.gluu.org",
    "links": [{
        "rel": "http://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer",
        "href": "https://idp.gluu.org"
    }]
}
```

Using the Issuer location discovered, the OpenID Provider's configuration information can be retrieved.

The RP makes the following request to the Issuer https://<domain>/.well-known/openid-configuration to obtain its
Configuration information:

```
GET /.well-known/openid-configuration HTTP/1.1
Host: idp.gluu.org

HTTP/1.1 200

The following is an example using the [oxAuth-Client](https://ox.gluu.org/maven/org/xdi/oxauth-client/) lib:

```
String resource = "acct:mike@idp.gluu.org";

OpenIdConnectDiscoveryClient openIdConnectDiscoveryClient = new OpenIdConnectDiscoveryClient(resource);
OpenIdConnectDiscoveryResponse openIdConnectDiscoveryResponse = openIdConnectDiscoveryClient.exec();

.....

OpenIdConfigurationClient client = new OpenIdConfigurationClient(configurationEndpoint);
OpenIdConfigurationResponse response = client.execOpenIdConfiguration();
```

### Algorithm
oxAuth supports various types of signature and encryption
algorithms for authorizing request parameter passing, ID token signature
and encryption, signing return responses, Encrypt User Info Endpoints
etc.

**Note:** It is a good practice to implement ID Token Signatures with the RSA
SHA-256 algorithm (algorithm value RS256). Additionally, oxAuth also
supports other algorithms that are listed below.

_Available Signature Algorithms:_ none, HS256, HS384, HS512, RS256, RS384, RS512, ES256, ES384, ES512.

_Encryption, Key Encryption Algorithms:_ RSA1_5, RSA-OAEP, A128KW, A256KW.

_Block Encryption Algorithms:_ A128CBC+HS256, A256CBC+HS612, A128GCM, A256GCM,

## Session management

Logout is a catch-22. There is no perfect answer to logout that
satisfies all the requirements of all the domains on the Internet. For
example, large OpenID Providers, like Google, need a totally stateless
implementation--Google cannot track sessions on the server side for
every browser on the Internet. But in smaller domains, server side
logout functionality can be a convenient solution to cleaning up
resources.

The OpenID Connect [Session
Management](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html) is
still marked as draft, and new mechanisms for logout are in the works.
The current specification requires JavaScript to detect that the session
has been ended in the browser. It works... unless the tab with the
JavaScript happens to be closed when the logout event happens on another
tab. Also, inserting JavaScript into every page is not feasible for some
applications. A new proposal is under discussion where the OpenID
Connect logout API would return `IMG` HTML tags to the browser with the
logout callbacks of the clients. This way, the browser could call the
logout uris (not the server).

The Gluu Server is very flexible, and supports both server side session
management, and stateless session management. For server side business
logout, the domain admin can use Custom Logout scripts. This can be
useful to clean up sessions in a legacy SSO system (i.e. SiteMinder), or
perhaps in a portal.

The key for logout is to understand the limitations of logout, and to
test the use cases that are important to you, so you will not be
surprised by the behavior when you put your application into production.
