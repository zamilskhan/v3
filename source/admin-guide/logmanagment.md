Gluu Server comes preloaded with four logs in this page as the screenshot portrays. The oxAuth, oxTrust, Cache Refresh and the console log is available by default.
Clicking on **Add log template** will bring up boxes where log path can be set to view the same from the GUI. The boxes on the
left contain the name/description of the log file, and the right boxes
contain the path of the log file such as _/opt/tomcat/logs/demo.log_.

# View Log File

The log files configured in the earlier section can be viewed using the
**View log file** feature. This feature can be accessed through the
configuration menu using **Configuration --> View Log File**.

The **Display last lines count** field contains the lines that will be
displayed in the Web GUI. If the field contains the value **400**, then
the Gluu Server will show the last 400 lines of the log in the GUI. The
screenshot below shows an according example.
