Some of the software was\nwritten by Gluu (everything with an \"ox\" prefix, like \"oxAuth\"), and\nsome of the software we forked from existing open source projects like\nthe Shibboleth SAML identity provider, Forgerock community release of\nOpenDJ, the Asimba SAML proxy, the CAS authentication server and many\nmore components that are part of the Linux distributions.\n\n\nLicense\n#\n\n\nAny software published by Gluu in the OX Project is under the \nMIT License\n.\nThe third party components have separate licenses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\n\n\nLicense\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShibboleth\n\n\nApache2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenDJ\n\n\nCDDL-1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsimba\n\n\nGNU APGL 3.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJagger\n\n\nMIT License\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nGluu maintains a fork of OpenDJ 3 in \nour Github\n.\n\n\n\n\nHistory\n#\n\n\nGluu was founded in 2009 by Mike Schwartz. After selling his ISP to\nVerio in 1998, Mike advised many large companies on identity and access\nmanagement, directory services, and application security. In late 2008,\nMike had a hunch that Web single sign-on was too complex, too\nproprietary and too expensive for many organizations. He felt that a\nutility approach to SSO using open source software could provide an\nalternative to expensive enterprise solutions. The Gluu Server was\nenvisioned as an integrated identity platform, based on free open source\nsoftware, to make application security available to significantly\ngreater number of organizations.\n\n\nVersions 1 and 2\n#\n\n\nVersions 1 of the Gluu Server was based on Sun OpenSSO and OpenDS. Mike\npresented the idea at an OpenSSO community group at the European\nIdentity Conference in Munich in May 2009. Version 1 worked a little,\nbut there was no easy way to manage it. Version 2 of the Gluu Server had\na better UI, but it was just a facade--the UI didn't actually do\nanything to configure OpenSSO. Version 2 was launched after Mike\nSchwartz met with members of the InCommon steering committee in San\nAntonio in October 2009. At that meeting, Mike expressed concern that\nOpenSSO might be end-of-life. Oracle had recently purchased Sun\nMicrosystems, and before ForgeRock was formed, it seemed possible that\nOracle would simply migrate OpenSSO customers to Oracle Access Manager.\nBob Morgan from the University of Washington convinced Mike that the\nShibboleth IdP was a reasonable alternative, and arguably had even more\nfeatures in SAML, including fine grain access release policies, and a\nbetter approach for multi-party federation. As the InCommon federation's\nefforts to evangelize SAML federation would support Gluu's message,\nswitching had marketing advantages, and would reduce the event risk\naround OpenSSO. Shortly thereafter, a new project from scratch was\nlaunched for Gluu Server v3 with the goal of using templates to simplify\nthe management of the Shibboleth IdP.\n\n\nVersion 3\n#\n\n\nThe first live demo of the Gluu Server was presented at an InCommon\nevent in Atlanta, GA in early November 2010. At that demo, Hakeem Fahm,\nthen IT director at the University of the District of Columbia, was\nimpressed and decided that the Gluu Server was exactly what his campus\nneeded to join InCommon. Delivering the first Gluu Server into\nproduction took three months. The order was placed before Thanksgiving,\nand it was finally delivered in early February 2011. Mike helped write\nsome of the python scripts (few, if any of which are still in use), and\nestablish the operating procedures for delivery of the Gluu Server. In\n2011, a few more campuses also adopted the Gluu Server.\n\n\nEnter OAuth2\n#\n\n\nOAuth2 had been on Gluu's roadmap since inception, but work started due\nto a consulting project Gluu had undertaken for\n\nIDCubed\n. This is the reason the OX software is\nMIT license--IDCubed insisted on it. The project was a flop--Gluu\ncouldn't deliver the graph based federated data solution quickly enough.\nBut as a result, Gluu was able to accelerate the launch of the OX OAuth2\nbased features, first with OpenID Connect in late 2011. Then in late\n2012, Gluu followed by introducing support for the User Managed Access\nProtocol, which Mike felt provided an Oauth2 based solution for access\nmanagement that was superior to Computer Associates' proprietary\nSiteminder access management framework.\n\n\nDesign Goals\n#\n\n\nAt OSCON 2014, Gluu introduced easier to install packages for the Gluu\nServer, and support for the Ubuntu Juju orchestration framework. The\ngoal of these distributions was to promote adoption of OX in the major\ndistributions of Linux.\n\n\nFree Open Source Identity Suite\n#\n\n\nOne of the things that has made access management difficult for\norganizations is that there is no one tool you can deploy to solve even\naverage requirements. The Gluu Server provides a recipe to deploy a\ncombination of the best free open source tools, working together.\n\n\nSupport most promising open standards\n#\n\n\nThe goal of the Gluu Server is to support the minimum number of\nstandards necessary to authenticate people, and to authorize them to\naccess the resources they need to do business for the domain. The Gluu\nServer should be practical about supporting older protocols, but always\nstrive to be the first implementer of the most promising new protocols.\n\n\nLeverage existing business processes\n#\n\n\nWhere possible, the Gluu Server goes to work with a minimal amount \nof changes to existing business processes. Don't \"rip and replace\",\nbut for new applications, use new protocols wherever possible to \navoid the creation of future upgrade work.\n\n\nFree license\n#\n\n\nThe components of the Gluu Server should be free to use in production.\nThis license strategy will produce the best software at the lowest \ntotal cost of ownership for the organization.\n\n\nWrite as a last resort\n#\n\n\nUse the best software that exists. If something the Gluu Server needs\ndoesn't exist, it may become an OX project. If some group comes along and\nwrites software better than an existing OX component, use it!\n\n\nNot just comprehensive, but easy to use\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server should make it easy for domain system administrators\nto control access to Web and network resources. Usability is more\nimportant than features.\n\n\nHorizontal scalability\n#\n\n\nSystem administrators should be able to add more servers to make the \nGluu Server scale as much as needed.\n\n\nExtreme flexibility\n#\n\n\nAs Kent Beck says, \"Embrace Change\". The key to the Gluu Server's success\nhas been its ability to handle all sorts of crazy requirements--quickly.\nSometimes raw speed is needed, but equally important is the ability for\nthe access management framework to be really smart.\n\n\nArchitecture\n#\n\n\nThere are several key components that make Gluu Server a reality and \nwhile choosing, the open-source softwares were given preference. Most \nof the components of the Gluu Server are written in Java, and\ndeployed as a web application in a J2EE servlet container.\nFollowing is a list of the technical components that comprise the Gluu Server.\n\n\nJ2EE Servlet container\n#\n\n\nMost of the components of the Gluu Server are written in Java, and\ndeployed as a web application in a J2EE servlet container. Java was\nchosen because there is a wide array of high quality libraries,\nconvenient container services, and tools for managing high performance\napplications at run-time. In order to run the Gluu Server, you don't\nhave to be a Java expert. But it does help to have some knowledge of how\nJava applications are deployed and managed in tomcat, or a similar\nservlet container.\n\n\nApache HTTP front end web server\n#\n\n\nAlthough there are pros and cons, we think its best to use the Apache\nHTTP server as the Internet facing Web server. There are a number of\nApache HTTP denial of service plugins. It is easier to handle re-directs\nfor things like discovery. And its convenient to have a non-J2EE way to\npublish static content. \n\n\nLDAP for Persistence\n#\n\n\nLDAP was chosen for persistence for a number of reasons: (1) we understood\nhow to scale an LDAP directory service horizontally to accommodate a data set\nof any size; (2) LDAP servers offer cost-effective and reliable replication\nservices; (3) as LDAP is a standard, the Gluu server would not be locked into\nthe persistence solution of one vendor; (4) LDAP had built-in support for SAML\nand OAuth2 components. In the future the OX project may develop additional\npersistence backends. But this is not likely for the near-term.\n\n\nWeb container plugins\n#\n\n\nToday, Web access management tools like CA Siteminder predominantly use\nthe web agent approach. Many large organizations have hundreds or\nthousands of \"web agents\" running on Apache and IIS.\n\n\nWeb agents are a great approach. Programmers don't have to know much\nabout the protocols. System administrators can configure the web server\nto use the central authorization server so we don't have to rely on the\nprogrammers to get security right. The programmers can obtain the user\nsession information in the environment variables. In OAuth2 information\nis serialized using JSON. For example, the entire id_token JWT is sent\nin one environment variable.\n\n\nIf developers want even more control, they can use the Gluu Server's\nAPI's directly: SAML, OpenID Connect, or UMA.",

The certificates should be updated manually \nin each host, when required. Move to \n/etc/certs/\n on the 1st node (inside the container). Copy all keys, certs and key storages conforming to these masks: \nhttpd.*\n, \nasimba.*\n, \nasimbaIDP.*\n and \nshibIDP.*\n to the same directory on the 2nd node (overwriting files that exist there; you may opt to backup them first, just in case).\n\n\nAfter that's done you still will need to update default system storage (\ncacerts\n file) at the 2nd node with these newly copied certificates.\n\n\n[Optional] Actions in case setup.properties.last method of installation didn't work for you\n#\n\n\nIn this case jks keystores you'll be moving to the 2nd node will be protected by passwords hardcoded into different configuration files on the 1st node, which are different from the similar passwords hardcoded into the same files on the 2nd node.\n\n\nThus you MUST ensure that the 1st node will be the one that will initialize the 2nd node during first csync's run (i.e., that it will win any conflicts due to changes in files that csync may detect during its very first run), as otherwise different components won't be able to decrypt these keystores and will fail.\n\n\nTo achieve this you should run initial sync manualy after completing configuring it, but before you install cron jobs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment out \nauto younger;\n string in \ncsync2.cfg\n on both nodes to disable autoresolution of conflicts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun \n# csync2 -crvvv -N idp1.gluu.org\n on the 1st node\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun \n# csync2 -crvvv -N idp2.gluu.org\n on the 2nd node\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious commands did initial scan and filled metadata database. Now run \n# csync2 -xrvvv -N idp1.gluu.org\n on the 1st node. That will try to sync files with the 2nd node, and most likely will fail to replicate all files due to some conflicts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should be now in a state of conflict, as certain files in directories to be synced differ between nodes and tool can't decide which to prefer. Run this \n# csync2 -frvvv -N idp1.gluu.org /\n on the 1st node to mark its files that still in dirty state as the ones that will win any conflict next time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun \n# csync2 -xrvvv -N idp1.gluu.org\n on the 1st node to complete your initial sync. Now all your 2nd node's directories covered by csync should be identical to the 1st node's.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncomment \nauto younger;\n string and proceed to installing cron jobs",

There is a photo icon on the right hand top side of the page which can be used to navigate to the user-profile and logging out of Gluu Server CE.\n\n\n\nThe menu on the left side of the welcome page is used to navigate the admin interface for Gluu Server. The menu has separate buttons for SAML, OpenID Connect and UMA. The user-management menu is found under \nUsers\n and the user-profile is under \nPersonal\n.\n\n\nConfiguration\n#\n\n\n\n\nThe configuration tab contians the tools to configure Gluu Server CE. This section is dedicated to all tuning and tinkering except integration tools.\nThe configuration menu is divided in to other sections which are revealed on click. The administrator can manage authentication, registration, attributes, cache-refresh,logs etc. from this menu.\n\n\nOrganization Configuration\n#\n\n\nThere are three sections in the organization configuration page which are \nSystem Configuration\n, \nSMTP Server Configuration\n and \nOxTrust Settings\n. These sections are detailed below with screenshots.\n\n\n\n\nSystem Configuration\n\nGluu Server CE is shipped with a built-in \nWhite Pages\n feature which can be enabled from the system configuration page. This page also contains the options to enable \nSelf-Service Password Reset\n which allows the Gluu Server users to reset their password via email. This options depends on the \nSMTP Server Configuration\n, also available under the organization configuration page. Additionally the \nSCIM Support\n can be enabled from the System Configuration page. If the organization uses any custom \nDNS Server(s)\n, the address should be updated from the System Configuration interface. \nMaximum Log Size (MB)*\n, by default Gluu UI will have 200 mb as the size of the log file and this value could be manipulated according to the administrator. Either this value could be increased or decreased depending on the HW specifications and contingency plan of the environment.\n\n\n\nSMTP Server Configuration\n\nThe mail server used by the Gluu Server to send notification to the pre-selected email address is configured in this page/panel. All the fields in this page are manadory and the configuration can be tested before confirmation. The fields are self-explanatory and simple such as hostname, user, password, ssl-requirement, authentication requirement, sending name and address.\n\n\n\nOxTrust Settings\n\nSome basic information abouht the administrator interface is available in this page. The administrator can find out the oxTrust build date and number by accessing the oxTrust settings page. The administrator can change the organization name, logo and favicon settings from this page as well. Finally oxTrust Settings page contains the name of the administrator group for Gluu Server. The users added in this group will have administrator access in Gluu Server where they will be able to maintain/configure the server.\n\n\n\n\nJSON Configuration\n#\n\n\nThe configuration files are accessible from the administrator interface (oxTrust). There are three tabs under the \nJSON Configuration\n menu\n\n\n\nThe oxtrust JSON configuration file is accessible from this tab and it can be edited from this page. The changes are updated by clicking on the \nUpdate\n button on the bottom of the page. \n\n\nThe oxAuth JSON configuration page gives easy access to the different endpoints used by Gluu Server CE. This page also contains the supported response, grants and algorithms among other information. The details will follow later on this documentation.\n\n\nThe oxTrust Import Person Configuration page contains the configuration for the file method of importing users into Gluu Server CE. The administrator can import users from a \nxls\n file which must be defined in this tab to import data in the LDAP attributes. The default format should contain the following fields\n\n\nManage Authentication\n#\n\n\nThe \nManage Authentication\n page contains the internal OpenDJ settings for Gluu Server CE. The \nDefault Authentication Method\n defines the authentication mechanism used for general authentication and oxTrust authentication. The separation is introduced because the users logging into Service Providers (SP) do not see the administrative console. The \noxTrust authentication mode\n decides the authentication mechasims for the users logging into the oxTrust admin interface.\n\n\n\nManage Custom Scripts\n#\n\n\nIt will not be an understatement to say that the custom script feature makes Gluu Server CE so robust and dynamic. The scripts are available for all intents and purposes the major being multi-factor authentication. There are many custom scritps included with the vanilla Gluu Server CE which can be enabled by clicking the check box.\n\n\n\n\nThe details about the custom scripts are given later in this guide.\n\n\nManage Registration\n#\n\n\nGluu Server CE is shiped with the feature to register users via the user-registration endpoint. The registry feature contains a Captcha which can be disabled from this page. Additionally it is possible to enable registration configuration from attributes.\n\n\nAttributes\n#\n\n\nThe attributes that are avalaible in the Gluu Server CE is found in this page. The administration can only see the active attributes when this page is accessed. The \nShow All Attributes\n button will show the inactive attributes too. Custom attributes can be added by clicking the \nAdd Attribute\n button and filling up a simple form. \n\n\n\n\nCache Refresh\n#\n\n\nCache Refresh is the mechanism used by Gluu Server CE to import users from a backend LDAP/AD data source. The entire configuration is handled from this page. The \nCache Refresh\n will notify the administrator of any problem with cache refresh the last time it was run. The frequency of cache refresh is also set from this page with the \nPolling interval (minutes)\n form. The key attributes, object class and the source attributes can be defined from the \nCustomer  BackendKey/Attributes\n tab. The backend server address, bind DN and other information must go to the \nSource Backend LDAP Servers\n tab.\n\n\nConfigure Log Viewer\n#\n\n\nThe logs for oxauth, oxtrust, cache refresh and the tomcat log can be configured from this tab. The log paths are given with the functionality to define any new log template with log file path.\n\n\nView Log File\n#\n\n\nThe log files are listed in the \nView Log File\n page under the \nAllowed Log Files\n tab. The individual logs can be tailed by clicking them. The \nConfiguration\n contains the last line count which will show the number of lines specified from the log in the \nTail of Log File\n tab. This section is an alternative to getting into the Gluu \nchroot\n and tailing the log files.\n\n\nServer Status\n#\n\n\nThis page will give some basic information about the Gluu Server such as the hostname, IP address, free memory & disk space. The number of users in the backend is also available in this page.\n\n\nCertificates\n#\n\n\nThe certificate page will give the certificate information for Gluu Server. The issuer info along with the algorithm used and the expiry date is also available.\n\n\nSAML\n#\n\n\nGluu Server CE contains all SAML related functionalities under the \nSAML\n tab divided into outbound and inbound SAML transactions. Inbound SAML is also known as ASIMBA. \n\n\nOutbound\n#\n\n\n\n\nThe \nTrust Relationships\n page, as the name suggests, will allow the administrator to view the created trust relationships (TRs) by searching using the search button. There is a button to add relationship with the same name. All the available TRs can be searched by using two (2) spaces in the search bar. There are some information that the administrator needs to gather before creating any new TR in Gluu Server. The metadata of the Service Provider (SP) connected using TR must be gathered along with the required attributes. The creation of TR will be covered in detail later.\n\n\nOpenID Connect\n#\n\n\nOpenID Connect is another protocol supported by Gluu Server CE following the \nopenID Connect specifications\n. The scopes page contains the \nAdd Scope\n button which can be used to add new scopes in Gluu Server. Additionally the available scopes can be searched by name or listed using two (2) spaces in the search bar.\n\n\n\n\nThe OpenID Connect clients are accessible from the \nClients\n page under \nOpenID Connect\n tab. The structure is similar to the scopes page with the functionality to search by name or use two (2) spaces to list all the available clients. New clients can be added by clicking the \nAdd Client\n button.\n\n\n\n\nUMA\n#\n\n\nUMA or (User-Managed Access) is an access management protocol supported by Gluu Server.The available scopes can be searched using the search bar on the top of the page. New scope descriptions can be added using the \nAdd Scope Description\n button.\n\n\n\nUMA resources page also has a searchbar on the top of the page and can be used to search for resource sets. New resource sets can be added by clocking on the \nAdd Resource Set\n button.\n\n\n\nUsers\n#\n\n\nUsers tab allows Gluu admin to do various task, including add admin, search users, Import users from file.\n\n\nPersonal\n#\n\n\nPersonal tab allows the individual person to view his basic profile and modify certain fields.",

A resource server or client can perform an HTTP GET on \nhttps://<hostname>/.well-known/uma-configuration\n to retrieve a JSON object indicating the UMA Provider configuration.\n\n\nThe following is an example of a GET request to the UMA configuration discovery endpoint:\n\n\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"issuer\": \"https://gluuserver.org\",\n  \"pat_profiles_supported\": [\n    \"bearer\"\n  ],\n  \"aat_profiles_supported\": [\n    \"bearer\"\n  ],\n  \"rpt_profiles_supported\": [\n    \"bearer\"\n  ],\n  \"pat_grant_types_supported\": [\n    \"authorization_code\"\n  ],\n  \"aat_grant_types_supported\": [\n    \"authorization_code\"\n  ],\n  \"claim_profiles_supported\": [\n    \"openid\"\n  ],\n  \"dynamic_client_endpoint\": \"https://gluuserver.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/register\",\n  \"token_endpoint\": \"https://gluuserver.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/token\",\n  \"user_endpoint\": \"https://gluuserver.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/authorize\",\n  \"introspection_endpoint\": \"https://gluuserver.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/host/status\",\n  \"resource_set_registration_endpoint\": \"https://gluuserver.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/host/rsrc\",\n  \"permission_registration_endpoint\": \"https://gluuserver.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/host/rsrc_pr\",\n  \"rpt_endpoint\": \"https://gluuserver.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/requester/rpt\",\n  \"authorization_request_endpoint\": \"https://gluuserver.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/requester/perm\",\n  \"scope_endpoint\": \"https://gluuserver.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/uma/scopes\"\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe UMA Response  may contain custom properties which are uniquely named for convenience and disguishing between standard & custom properties.\n\n\n\n\nOAuth2.0\n#\n\n\n\n\nOAuth2.0 is the next version in the OAuth protocol focusing on simplicity with specific authorization flows for different platforms. The core specification is called the \nOAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework\n. OAuth introduces an authorization layer and separates the role of the client from the resource owner. The resource is accessed using access tokens instead of credentials.\n\n\nTerminology\n#\n\n\n\n\nResource Owner (RO): Entity that owns and controls the access to any resource\n\n\nResource Server (RS): Where the resources are held\n\n\nClient: Any application/web-site that requests access to the protected resource stored in any RS.\n\n\nAuthorization Server: The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization\n\n\n\n\nWorkflows\n#\n\n\nCredentials Grant\n#\n\n\nThe Client Credentials Grant allows \nRO\n to use username and password as an authorization grant to obtain an access token. This flow is only encouraged when there is high degree of trust between \nRO\n and the client and no other grant types are not available.\n\n\nAlthough this grant requires direct client access to the \nRO\n credentials it is used for a single request for an access token. This grant type can eliminate the need for the client to store the \nRO\n credentials for future use, by exchanging the credentials with a long-lived access token or refresh token.\n\n\n\n\nThe steps of the flow are:\n\n\n\n\nThe application requests an access token from the authorization server, authenticating the request with its client credentials.\n\n\nIf the client credentials are successfully authenticated, an access token is returned to the client.\n\n\n\n\nThis flow should be used when the resources of or any application/service are stored externally in cloud storages such as Google Storage or Amazon S3 which can be accessed using API. In this case the application needs to read and update these resources, but acting on behalf of the app itself rather than any individual user. The application can ask the OAuth authorization server for an access token directly, without the involvement of any end user.\n\n\nThe following is an example showing the messages between the client and the authorization server, also the example shows code fragments using the oxAuth-Client.jar API to interact with the authorization server.\n\n\n// Parameters\nString tokenUrl = \"https://seed.gluu.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/token\";\n\n// Request\nTokenClient tokenClient = new TokenClient(tokenUrl);\nTokenResponse response = tokenClient.execClientCredentialsGrant(scope, clientId, clientSecret);\n\nint status response.getStatus(); // 200 if succeed\nString accessToken = response.getAccessToken();\nTokenType tokenType response.getTokenType(); // bearer\n\n\n\n\nThe message sent to the authorization server is\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOST /oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/token HTTP/1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost: seed.gluu.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorization: Basic QCExMTExITAwMDghRkY4MSEyRDM5OjYyMTNlOWI5LWM0NmQtNDAwOC04YWYxLTAzZjkxOGE4YWRlNA==\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngrant_type=client_credentials&scope=storage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse upon successful authentication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCache-Control: no-store, private\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPragma: no-cache\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\"access_token\":\"c769d7ff-c476-42ab-b531-fe2f60b2f5cc\",\"token_type\":\"bearer\",\"expires_in\":3600}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResource Owner Password Credential Grant\n#\n\n\nThis grant allows the usage of \nRO\n password credentials as an authorization grant to obtain an access token. This grant is encouraged in a high trust situation as well. The diagram below shows the flow\n\n\n\n\nThe steps of the flow are:\n1. User presents their credentials to the application in addition to a username and password.\n2. If the client credentials are successfully authenticated, an access token is returned to the client\n\n\nThis flow should be sparingly used bacause the password for the \nRO\n is exposed to the appilcation/client. It is recommended only for first-party \"official\"  applications released by the API provider, and not opened up to wider third-party developer communities. If a user is asked to toe their password into \"official\" applications, they may become acustomed to doing so and becom evulneralbe to phishing attempts by other apps. In order to mitigat this concern, developers and IT administrators should clearly educate their users how they should dertermine which apps are \"official\" and which are not.\n\n\nThe following is an example showing the messages between the client and the authorization server, also the example shows code fragments using the oxAuth-Client.jar API to interact with the authorization server.\n\n\n// Parameters\nString tokenUrl = \"https://seed.gluu.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/token\";\n\n// Call the service\nTokenClient tokenClient = new TokenClient(tokenUrl);\nTokenResponse response = tokenClient.execResourceOwnerPasswordCredentialsGrant(username, password, scope, clientId, clientSecret);\n\n// Handle response\nint status = response.getStatus(); // 200 if succeed\nString accessToken = response.getAccessToken(); // 26d55e4b-6c61-40ea-9763-3282f5db0f0e\nTokenType tokenType = response.getTokenType(); // Enumeration: bearer\nString refreshToken = response.getRefreshToken(); // aba91bd9-aa10-4fca-952b-50a9a9afac28\n\n\n\n\nThe message sent to the authorization server is\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOST /oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/token HTTP/1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost: seed.gluu.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorization: Basic QCExMTExITAwMDghRkY4MSEyRDM5OjYyMTNlOWI5LWM0NmQtNDAwOC04YWYxLTAzZjkxOGE4YWRlNA==\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngrant_type=password&scope=openid&username=mike&password=secret\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse upon successful authentication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCache-Control: no-store, private\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPragma: no-cache\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\"access_token\":\"26d55e4b-6c61-40ea-9763-3282f5db0f0e\",\"token_type\":\"bearer\",\"expires_in\":3599,\"refresh_token\":\"aba91bd9-aa10-4fca-952b-50a9a9afac28\",\"scope\":\"openid\",\"id_token\":\"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvc2VlZC5nbHV1Lm9yZyIsInVzZXJfaWQiOiJtaWtlIiwiYXVkIjoiQCExMTExITAwMDghRkY4MSEyRDM5IiwiZXhwIjoxMzM5MTk2ODgxMzAzLCJveEludW0iOiJAITExMTEhMDAwMCFENEU3Iiwib3hWYWxpZGF0aW9uVVJJIjoiaHR0cHM6XC9cL3NlZWQuZ2x1dS5vcmdcL294YXV0aFwvc2VhbVwvcmVzb3VyY2VcL3Jlc3R2MVwvb3hhdXRoXC9jaGVja19zZXNzaW9uIiwib3hPcGVuSURDb25uZWN0VmVyc2lvbiI6Im9wZW5pZGNvbm5lY3QtMS4wIn0.SzWfJsmlz62qTRw1lEJZ8PygY9eRupgmsbXLCQwPVDQ\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGluu OAuth2 Access Management\n#\n\n\nSecurity Properties\n#\n\n\nThere are some security benefits to using this flow against authenticating API calls with a username and password (via HTTP Basic access authentication or similar) although the application has access to the resource owner's password. With Basic authentication, an application needs to have continuous access to the user\u2019s password in order to make API calls. If the user wants to revoke the access of the client, he must change the password and re-enter the password in all the applications that are allowed access to the resource.\n\n\nHowever, if the OAuth Resource Owner Password flow is used, the application only needs access to the user\u2019s credentials once: on first use when the credentials are exchanged for an access token. This means there\u2019s no requirement for the app to store these credentials within the application or on the device, and revoking access is easy as well.\n\n\nUser Experience\n#\n\n\nThe user experience for this flow is identical to typical password-based access requests. The application asks the user for their username and password and the user provides the information. The application then makes either a server-side or client-side request to the API provider\u2019s authorization server, without any user-facing interface changes. If the API provider does not issue a refresh_token and the issued access_token is short-lived, the application will likely store the username and password for future authentication attempts. Unfortunately, this defeats some of the benefit of this flow.\n\n\nGluu OAuth2 Access Management\n#\n\n\nThis flow uses Gluu Access Token (GAT) for access management. The flow needs a profile enabling a client to obtain a token from the \nAS\n by explicitly specifyting the requested scopes. The diagram below shows the overview of the flow.\n\n\n\n\nGAT\n as a plain json object looks like the example below\n\n\n{\n    \"exp\": 1256953732,\n    \"iat\": 1256912345,\n    \"scopes\" : {\n       \"view\", \"manage\"\n    }\n} \n\n\n\n\nThe \nGAT\n is issued at the endpoint published at \nhttps://<hostname>/.well-known/uma-configuration\n. Please note that all requests/response to/from/between RP, [RS][], \nAS\n must contain \"\nGAT\n\" HTTP header with \ntrue\n value. In this way \nAS\n differentiantes calls from normal UMA.The example below shows a response with \nGAT\n value set to \ntrue\n.\n\n\nPOST /gat HTTP/1.1\nHost: as.example.com\nAuthorization: Bearer jwfLG53^sad$#f\nGAT: true\n\n{\n \"scopes\": [\"view\", \"manage\"]\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe message sent to the authorization server is\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET /users/alice/album/photo.jpg HTTP/1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorization: Bearer vF9dft4qmT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost: gluu.example.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGAT: true\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse with \nrpt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGAT: true\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"rpt\": \"sbjsbhs(/SSJHBSUSSJHVhjsgvhsgvshgsv\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCIM\n#\n\n\nSCIM stands for System for Cross-domain Identity Management which is a specification to manage users in a cloud environment. Gluu Server supports SCIM version 1.0 and 2.0 out of the box. The following diagram shows the SCIM model from the \nSCIM Website\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe SCIM Specifications are available from the SCIM Website. There are two specifications in SCIM 2.0:\n\n\n\n\nSCIM 2.0 Core Specifications\n\n\nSCIM 2.0 Protocol Specification\n\n\n\n\nTerminology\n#\n\n\nThe SCIM specification defines some basic terms that are used in the document. The basic terms like attribute, [SP][] are same across all the protocols. A few confusing ones are listed below from the \nSCIM 2.0 Specs\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResource:  An artifact that is managed by a service provider and that\n      contains one or more attributes, e.g., \"User\" or \"Group\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResource Type:  A type of a resource that is managed by a service provider.  The\n      resource type defines the resource name, endpoint URL, schemas,\n      and other metadata that indicate where a resource is managed and\n      how it is composed, e.g., \"User\" or \"Group\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchema: A collection of attribute definitions that describe the contents of an entire or partial resource, e.g.,\n      \"urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe details of the SCIM API are given later in this documentation.",

            "text": "OAuth2.0 is the next version in the OAuth protocol focusing on simplicity with specific authorization flows for different platforms. The core specification is called the  OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework . OAuth introduces an authorization layer and separates the role of the client from the resource owner. The resource is accessed using access tokens instead of credentials.  Terminology #   Resource Owner (RO): Entity that owns and controls the access to any resource  Resource Server (RS): Where the resources are held  Client: Any application/web-site that requests access to the protected resource stored in any RS.  Authorization Server: The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization   Workflows #  Credentials Grant #  The Client Credentials Grant allows  RO  to use username and password as an authorization grant to obtain an access token. This flow is only encouraged when there is high degree of trust between  RO  and the client and no other grant types are not available.  Although this grant requires direct client access to the  RO  credentials it is used for a single request for an access token. This grant type can eliminate the need for the client to store the  RO  credentials for future use, by exchanging the credentials with a long-lived access token or refresh token.   The steps of the flow are:   The application requests an access token from the authorization server, authenticating the request with its client credentials.  If the client credentials are successfully authenticated, an access token is returned to the client.   This flow should be used when the resources of or any application/service are stored externally in cloud storages such as Google Storage or Amazon S3 which can be accessed using API. In this case the application needs to read and update these resources, but acting on behalf of the app itself rather than any individual user. The application can ask the OAuth authorization server for an access token directly, without the involvement of any end user.  The following is an example showing the messages between the client and the authorization server, also the example shows code fragments using the oxAuth-Client.jar API to interact with the authorization server.  // Parameters\nString tokenUrl = \"https://seed.gluu.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/token\";\n\n// Request\nTokenClient tokenClient = new TokenClient(tokenUrl);\nTokenResponse response = tokenClient.execClientCredentialsGrant(scope, clientId, clientSecret);\n\nint status response.getStatus(); // 200 if succeed\nString accessToken = response.getAccessToken();\nTokenType tokenType response.getTokenType(); // bearer  The message sent to the authorization server is     Request      POST /oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/token HTTP/1.1    Host: seed.gluu.org    Authorization: Basic QCExMTExITAwMDghRkY4MSEyRDM5OjYyMTNlOWI5LWM0NmQtNDAwOC04YWYxLTAzZjkxOGE4YWRlNA==    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded    grant_type=client_credentials&scope=storage        Response upon successful authentication      HTTP/1.1 200    Content-Type: application/json    Cache-Control: no-store, private    Pragma: no-cache    {\"access_token\":\"c769d7ff-c476-42ab-b531-fe2f60b2f5cc\",\"token_type\":\"bearer\",\"expires_in\":3600}     Resource Owner Password Credential Grant #  This grant allows the usage of  RO  password credentials as an authorization grant to obtain an access token. This grant is encouraged in a high trust situation as well. The diagram below shows the flow   The steps of the flow are:\n1. User presents their credentials to the application in addition to a username and password.\n2. If the client credentials are successfully authenticated, an access token is returned to the client  This flow should be sparingly used bacause the password for the  RO  is exposed to the appilcation/client. It is recommended only for first-party \"official\"  applications released by the API provider, and not opened up to wider third-party developer communities. If a user is asked to toe their password into \"official\" applications, they may become acustomed to doing so and becom evulneralbe to phishing attempts by other apps. In order to mitigat this concern, developers and IT administrators should clearly educate their users how they should dertermine which apps are \"official\" and which are not.  The following is an example showing the messages between the client and the authorization server, also the example shows code fragments using the oxAuth-Client.jar API to interact with the authorization server.  // Parameters\nString tokenUrl = \"https://seed.gluu.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/token\";\n\n// Call the service\nTokenClient tokenClient = new TokenClient(tokenUrl);\nTokenResponse response = tokenClient.execResourceOwnerPasswordCredentialsGrant(username, password, scope, clientId, clientSecret);\n\n// Handle response\nint status = response.getStatus(); // 200 if succeed\nString accessToken = response.getAccessToken(); // 26d55e4b-6c61-40ea-9763-3282f5db0f0e\nTokenType tokenType = response.getTokenType(); // Enumeration: bearer\nString refreshToken = response.getRefreshToken(); // aba91bd9-aa10-4fca-952b-50a9a9afac28  The message sent to the authorization server is     Request      POST /oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/token HTTP/1.1    Host: seed.gluu.org    Authorization: Basic QCExMTExITAwMDghRkY4MSEyRDM5OjYyMTNlOWI5LWM0NmQtNDAwOC04YWYxLTAzZjkxOGE4YWRlNA==    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded    grant_type=password&scope=openid&username=mike&password=secret        Response upon successful authentication      HTTP/1.1 200    Content-Type: application/json    Cache-Control: no-store, private    Pragma: no-cache    {\"access_token\":\"26d55e4b-6c61-40ea-9763-3282f5db0f0e\",\"token_type\":\"bearer\",\"expires_in\":3599,\"refresh_token\":\"aba91bd9-aa10-4fca-952b-50a9a9afac28\",\"scope\":\"openid\",\"id_token\":\"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvc2VlZC5nbHV1Lm9yZyIsInVzZXJfaWQiOiJtaWtlIiwiYXVkIjoiQCExMTExITAwMDghRkY4MSEyRDM5IiwiZXhwIjoxMzM5MTk2ODgxMzAzLCJveEludW0iOiJAITExMTEhMDAwMCFENEU3Iiwib3hWYWxpZGF0aW9uVVJJIjoiaHR0cHM6XC9cL3NlZWQuZ2x1dS5vcmdcL294YXV0aFwvc2VhbVwvcmVzb3VyY2VcL3Jlc3R2MVwvb3hhdXRoXC9jaGVja19zZXNzaW9uIiwib3hPcGVuSURDb25uZWN0VmVyc2lvbiI6Im9wZW5pZGNvbm5lY3QtMS4wIn0.SzWfJsmlz62qTRw1lEJZ8PygY9eRupgmsbXLCQwPVDQ\"}     Gluu OAuth2 Access Management #  Security Properties #  There are some security benefits to using this flow against authenticating API calls with a username and password (via HTTP Basic access authentication or similar) although the application has access to the resource owner's password. With Basic authentication, an application needs to have continuous access to the user\u2019s password in order to make API calls. If the user wants to revoke the access of the client, he must change the password and re-enter the password in all the applications that are allowed access to the resource.  However, if the OAuth Resource Owner Password flow is used, the application only needs access to the user\u2019s credentials once: on first use when the credentials are exchanged for an access token. This means there\u2019s no requirement for the app to store these credentials within the application or on the device, and revoking access is easy as well.  User Experience #  The user experience for this flow is identical to typical password-based access requests. The application asks the user for their username and password and the user provides the information. The application then makes either a server-side or client-side request to the API provider\u2019s authorization server, without any user-facing interface changes. If the API provider does not issue a refresh_token and the issued access_token is short-lived, the application will likely store the username and password for future authentication attempts. Unfortunately, this defeats some of the benefit of this flow.  Gluu OAuth2 Access Management #  This flow uses Gluu Access Token (GAT) for access management. The flow needs a profile enabling a client to obtain a token from the  AS  by explicitly specifyting the requested scopes. The diagram below shows the overview of the flow.   GAT  as a plain json object looks like the example below  {\n    \"exp\": 1256953732,\n    \"iat\": 1256912345,\n    \"scopes\" : {\n       \"view\", \"manage\"\n    }\n}   The  GAT  is issued at the endpoint published at  https://<hostname>/.well-known/uma-configuration . Please note that all requests/response to/from/between RP, [RS][],  AS  must contain \" GAT \" HTTP header with  true  value. In this way  AS  differentiantes calls from normal UMA.The example below shows a response with  GAT  value set to  true .  POST /gat HTTP/1.1\nHost: as.example.com\nAuthorization: Bearer jwfLG53^sad$#f\nGAT: true\n\n{\n \"scopes\": [\"view\", \"manage\"]\n}  The message sent to the authorization server is     Request      GET /users/alice/album/photo.jpg HTTP/1.1    Authorization: Bearer vF9dft4qmT    Host: gluu.example.com    GAT: true        Response with  rpt      HTTP/1.1 200 OK    Content-Type: application/json    GAT: true    {    \"rpt\": \"sbjsbhs(/SSJHBSUSSJHVhjsgvhsgvshgsv\"    }",

Here are some\n\ninstructions\n\nfor these steps.\n\n\nThe first thing you'll need to do is Create a Project on Google to obtain\nclient credentials. Click \"Create project\" and enter your desired\nproject name.\n\n\n\n\nThen click on your newly created project from the listing on the\ndashboard, and under the Credentials section, create a new \"OAuth2 2.0\nclient ID\". \n\n\n\n\nGoogle will ask you to configure your consent screen, to add your logo\nand other information displayed to the user to authorize Google to\nrelease information.\n\n\n\n\nFill out the form...\n\n\n\n\nNow you're ready to create the credentials. Enter \"Authorized JavaScript\norigins\". It should be the uri of your Gluu Server--for example\n\nhttps://idp.example.com\n.\n\n\n\n\nGoogle will display the client-id and the according secret ... ignore\nit. Instead, download the JSON file which you are going to upload into\nyour Gluu Server, next.\n\n\n\n\nMove this file to the location \n/opt/tomcat/conf/google.json\n. The JSON\nfile will look something like this example (no... these data are not\nvalid credentials!):\n\n\n{\n  \"web\": {\n    \"client_id\": \"7a64e55f-724d4e8c91823d5f1f18a0b2.apps.googleusercontent.com\",\n    \"auth_uri\": \"https:\\/\\/accounts.google.com\\/o\\/oauth2\\/auth\",\n    \"token_uri\": \"https:\\/\\/accounts.google.com\\/o\\/oauth2\\/token\",\n    \"auth_provider_x509_cert_url\": \"https:\\/\\/www.googleapis.com\\/oauth2\\/v1\\/certs\",\n    \"client_secret\": \"bb76a2c99be94e35b874\",\n    \"javascript_origins\": [\n    \"https:\\/\\/brookie.gluu.info\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe last step is to enable Google+ API's:\n\n\n\n\nNavigate back to the Google API \nconsole\n\n\nSelect project and enter project name\n\n\nOpen new project \"API & auth -> API\" menu item in configuration navigation tree\n\n\nClick \"Google+ API\"\n\n\nClick \"Enable API\" button\n\n\n\n\nConfigure oxTrust\n#\n\n\nFollow the steps below to configure the certificate authentication in the oxTrust Admin GUI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to Manage Custom Scripts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \nAdd Custom Scritp\n button\n\nadd-script-button\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill up the form and add the \nGoogle External Authenticator\n Script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll also need to add some custom properties:\n\n\n\n\ngplus_client_secrets_file\n: \n/opt/tomcat/conf/google.json\n\n\ngplus_deployment_type\n: enroll\n\n\ngplus_remote_attributes_list\n: email, given_name, family_name, and locale\n\n\n\n\ngplus_local_attributes_list\n: uid, mail, givenName, sn, cn, preferredLanguage\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngplus_client_secrets_file\n - It is a mandatory property that holds\n   the path to the application configuration file downloaded from Google\n   console for application. An example is \n/etc/certs/gplus_client_secrets.json\n.\n   These are the single steps needed to get it:\n    a) Log into: \nhttps://console.developers.google.com/project\n\n    b) Click \"Create project\" and enter project name\n    c) Open new project \"API & auth -> Credentials\" menu item in configuration navigation tree\n    d) Click \"Add credential\" with type \"OAuth 2.0 client ID\"\n    e) Select \"Web application\" application type\n    f) Enter \"Authorized JavaScript origins\". It should be CE server DNS\n       name, for example \nhttps://gluu.info\n.\n    g) Click \"Create\" and Click \"OK\" in next dialog\n    h) Click \"Download JSON\" in order to download\n       \ngplus_client_secrets.json\n file.\n    Also it is mandatory to enable Google+ API:\n    a) Log into \nhttps://console.developers.google.com/project\n\n    b) Select project and enter project name\n    c) Open new project \"API & auth -> API\" menu item in configuration navigation tree\n    d) Click \"Google+ API\"\n    e) Click \"Enable API\" button\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngplus_deployment_type\n - Specify the deployment mode. It is an\noptional property. If this property isn't specified the script tries to\nfind the user in the local LDAP by 'subject_identifier' claim specified\nin id_token. If this property has a 'map' value the script allows to map\n'subject_identifier' to the local user account. If this property has an\n'enroll' value the script adds a new user to the local LDAP with status\n'active'. In order to map the IDP attributes to the local attributes it\nuses properties from both gplus_remote_attributes_list and\ngplus_local_attributes_list. The allowed values are map and enroll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngplus_remote_attributes_list\n - Comma-separated list of attribute\nnames (user claims) that Google+ returns which map to local attributes\nin the \ngplus_local_attributes_list\n property. It is mandatory only if\n\ngplus_deployment_type\n is set to 'enroll'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngplus_local_attributes_list\n - Comma-separated list of Gluu Server\nLDAP attribute names that are mapped to Google user claims from the\n\ngplus_remote_attributes_list\n property. It is mandatory only if\n\ngplus_deployment_type\n is set to 'enroll'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nextension_module\n - Optional property to specify the full path of\nan external module that implements two methods:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    # This is called when the authentication script initializes\n    def init(conf_attr):\n        # Code here\n        return True/False\n\n    # This is called after authentication\n    def postLogin(conf_attr, user):\n        # Code here\n        return True    # or return False\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngplus_client_configuration_attribute\n - Optional property to\nspecify the client entry attribute name which can override\n\ngplus_client_secrets_file file\n content. It can be used in cases when\nall clients should use a separate \ngplus_client_secrets.json\n\nconfiguration.\n\n\n\n\nTesting\n#\n\n\nOne simple way to test the configuration is to use oxTrust. In the\n\"Configure Authentication\" dropdown menu, select \"Google\" (or whatever\nyou entered as the \"Name\" of the custom authentication script--as the\ndefault authentication method.\n\n\n\n\nAfter you login and logout, you should be presented with a new login\nform that has the Google login button:\n\n\n\n\nAfter clicking the Google login button, you are presented for\nauthorization--Google needs to make sure its ok to release attributes to\nthe Gluu Server:\n\n\n\n\nIf the script doesn't work, and you locked yourself out of oxTrust,\ndon't worry! You can create an LDIF file, for example \nrevert.ldif\n, to\nset back the default authentication method, like this:\n\n\ndn: inum=@!1E3B.F133.14FA.5062!0002!4B66.CF9C,ou=appliances,o=gluu\nchangetype: modify\nreplace: oxAuthenticationMode\noxAuthenticationMode: internal\n\n\n\n\noxAuthenticationMode corresponds to the 'Name' of the customer\nauthentication script in oxTrust. Use \ninternal\n to revert to the\ndefault LDAP authentication. You'll have to change the \ninum\n with the\n\ninum\n of your installation. You can find it using ldapsearch like this:\n\n\n/opt/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1389 -D \"cn=directory manager\" -j ~/.pw -b \"ou=appliances,o=gluu\" -s one \"objectclass=*\" inum\n\n\n\n\n~/.pw\n is a file with your Directory Manager password. If you don't\nremember it, try to find it using \ngrep\n: \n\n\ngrep ldapPass= /install/community-edition-setup/setup.properties.last\n\n\n\n\nOnce your LDIF looks ok, then use \nldapmodify\n to revert back to\npassword authentication:\n\n\n/opt/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -h localhost -p 1389 -D \"cn=directory manager\" -j ~/.pw -f revert.ldif\n\n\n\n\nIf things go wrong, it can leave the sessions in your browser in a bad\nstate. If things get really weird, remove the cookies in your browser\nfor the hostname of your Gluu Server.\n\n\nTwilio multi-factor Authentication - OTP using custom script\n#\n\n\nWriting a Custom Authentication Script\n#\n\n\nIn this document we walk through the steps of writing a script to implement OTP authentication using \nTwilio\n to send an SMS code for a two-step out-of-band authentication mechanism.\n\n\nAt the end of this tutorial you should have a better understanding of how to write your own custom scripts. For reference, you can review the completed Twilio custom authentication script \nhere\n. \n\n\nFields in Custom Script:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nName of the Script\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n[optional] Description about the script\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramming Language\n\n\nCurrently Python is supported, In future jscript and Java script might be added\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\n\n\nAuthentication Level for the authentication, which determines the security level\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation Type\n\n\nDetermines the script location.

Web, Native or Both\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustome Property\n\n\nDetermines the key and value of the custom property, which can added to the authentication to pass the values\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScript Box\n\n\nScript Box will displayed if Location Type is selected as \"File\", to enter the path of the script\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScript\n\n\nScript Box will be displayed when Location Type is selected as \"LDAP\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom Script Location\n#\n\n\nCustom scripts can either be inserted directly into the Gluu Server interface or you can specify a path to the script. Specifying a path will make script development easier. There is also an option to revert back to a working script if the script is faulty or needs further enhancements. The administrator can select \nFile\n from the Script Location Type in oxTrust and the file input box will be displayed:\n\n\n\n\nThe 'LDAP' option in the Script Location Type can be used to store the script in the LDAP tree once the development is complete. Remember that selecting the \nLDAP\n method requires the script to be copied in the input box that appears upon LDAP selection:\n\n\n\n\nSuggested Development Environment\n#\n\n\nGluu Server custom scripts are written in \nJython\n. It is recommended to use Eclipse for coding purposes.\n\n\nNow, create some files:\n- A Python file for your script\n- One or more XHTML files if you have a custom form for your authentication\n- One or more XML files (you'll need one for each XHTML file) that provide some information to the Tomcat server about how to display the XHTML file.\n\n\nSamples and Documentation\n#\n\n\nThere are many good examples of authentication interception scripts checked into Gluu's\n\n\noxAuth integrations folder\n. Also, the respective \nXHTML\n and \nXML\n files are checked in to the \nauth folder\n.\nThe interfaces for the authentication interception can be found in the \nGluu Documentation\n.\n\n\nWe used the \nBasic Script\n \nas a template. The \nWikid forms\n were also used as a template since it is required to pass the value of the \"code\" obtained from Twilio to step 2 of the authentication in order to validate and authenticate the user.\n\n\nThe \nWikid authentication\n script was also looked upon quite a bit for examples on how to process the form.\n\n\nImplement methods\n#\n\n\nSimple example of how to add a custom template and how to pass values between 2 steps of authentication and save the value temporarily for authentication of a user. Our Sample \n\nTwilio script\n\n\n\n\nLogin to Gluu UI\n\n\nNavigate to \"Configuration\" on the Menu panel to the left\n\n\nSelect Manage Custom Scripts\n\n\nScroll to the end of the page and click on \"Add custom script configuration\"\n\n\nEnter the Name, Description, Programming Language (Python will be by default, may be in future Java or JavaSCript will be added)\n\n\nSelect the Level needed to set the security level to.\n\n\nSelect Location Type from the script to be executed.\n\n\nSelect the Usage Type required for the authentication.\n\n\nDefine Custom property which is provided by Twilio and can be noted down from Twilio account page of the signed up user. \n\n\nClick on Enabled to enable the added custom script.\n\n\nScroll down to the end of the update and click on Update button to submit the form. \n\n\nAfter the custom script is added, click on Manage Authenticaion on the Menu Panel to left. \n\n\nSelect \"Default Authentication Method\" tab and change the oxTrust authentication mode to \"Twilio\" or \"Name of the script\" from the drop down.\n\n\n\n\nNote: All three below custom properties are mandatory for the Twilio Two-Factor Authentication script to work\n\n\n\n\nACCOUNT_SID - Numerical sequence of numbers, to identify the token assigned to the user associated with Twilio.\n\n\nAUTH TOKEN  - Alphanumerical number provided by Twilio for the account holder to identify the user.\n\n\nFROM_NUMBER - Number which is either assigned by Twilio or can be a number user provides to send the code from.\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in the below illustration:\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n#\n\n\nauthenticate():\n\n\nThe most important method to implement is obviously the \nauthenticate\n method. This is where the main business logic is located for\nthe authentication workflow. It is possible to switch on the step, with the \nif (step == 1):\n statement. In oxAuth, there is no\nassumption that step 1 and step 2 happen on the same server, therefore the value stored in the LDAP using a temporarily created attribute and retrieved in step 2. There the step is sent into the \nauthenticate\n method, which helps to save and retrieve the values whereever required.\n\n\nBelow are few Methods and Libraries used to Save the Value to LDAP and retrieve the values as per the requirement.\n\n\nrandom.randit()\n \nrandom.randit(\"start number\",\"\"end number\"), Generates the code as per designer or requirements. \nExample: random.randit(10000,99999)\n\n\ncontext.set()\n\nThis particular method is obtained from jboss to pass the session attribute value to ldap, by creating a temporary attribute which has limited life time and can be retrieved within the life span, expires and session becomes invalid. Save the value of the code obtained through the code generator method. context.set(\"Name of the temp attribute\", \n<key>\n). Where \n<key>\n is the value that needs to be stored temporarily in ldap.\nExample:\ncontext.set(\"code\",code)\n\n\nUserService.instance()\n \nGets the user login instance\n\n\nServerUtil.getFirstValue():\n\n\nTo access  information from requestParameters in your script with \nServerUtil.getFirstValue(requestParameters, <key>)\n where \n<key>\n\nspecifies the value you want to retrieve, you can also use another method \nrequestParameters.get(\"<key>\")\n\nwhere \n<key>\n specifies the value you want to retrieve .\n\n\nuserService.getUserByAttribute():\n\n\ngetUserByAttribute(\"LDAP Attribute\", <key>)\n method access the information in LDAP and retrieves the value of the attribute comparing the value of the \n<Key>\n.\nExample:\nuserService.getUserByAttribute(\"uid\", user_name)\n\n\ngetAttribute():\n\nTo retrieve the value of an attribute from LDAP, getAttribute(\"LDAP Attribute name\") can be used. \nExample:\ngetAttribute(\"mobile\")\n\n\nrequestParameters.get():\n\nTo retrieve values passed from the form through header can be obtained by using the method requestParameters.get(\n<key>\n). This will retrieve the values from the form via header and can be stored in a string. Where \n<key>\n is the value to be retrieved from header.\nExample:\nabc = requestParameters.get(\"passcode\")[0].strip()\n\n\ngetCountAuthenticationSteps():\n\n\nAnother method usually needed to implement is \ngetCountAuthenticationSteps\n. This method normally just returns 1, 2, or 3. If implementing an adaptive authentication strategy,\nwhere the number of steps depends on the context. Check out the\nDuo script for a good example of this. In our sample \n\nDuo script\n,\n\n\nDuo Script was scripted only for those who wanted to use Duo\nfor the IT group. So this was checked for group membership, and dynamically adjusted the number of steps. And this can be scripted for any logic or attribute to the check the authentication, like \"country\" or \"region\".\n\n\ngetExtraParametersForStep():\n\n\nIf required to save session variables between steps, use the \ngetExtraParametersForStep\n method. The Gluu Server persists\nthese variables in LDAP in able to support stateless clustered two\nstep authentications.\n\n\ngetPageForStep():\n\n\nIf required to display a special Web page for an interactive\nlogin, (or even a custom first page) you'll need to implement the\n\ngetPageForStep\n which specifies the page you want to return for a given\nstep.\n\n\nsession_attributes.get():\n\nThe attribute value that are saved by the session using context.set. This method is derived from the oxauth core java libraries and called using the SessionState parameters which is defined in the code or programme.\nsession_attributes.get(\n<key>\n), where \n<key>\n is the session atribute value that is stored in the ldap.\nExample:\nsession_attributes.get(\"code\")\n\n\nSaving the value in LDAP and Passing values between two steps\n#\n\n\nSaving Values:\n#\n\n\ncontext.set\n can be used to save values of the required key to an attribute temporarily and the created temporary attribute will be alive only for limited time and expires and gets removed, by that way, adding new attribute to the user is not messed up. And also the expired attribute kills the validity of the session and becomes invalid.\n\n\nRetriving and passing values between the authentication steps:\n#\n\n\nUsing \nsession_attribute.get()\n method, stored session attribute could be retrieved anywhere between the authentication method, by that way the values can be passed between two authentication methods for verification and validation.\nGenerated code and the entered \"code\" in the form can be verified using a simple if and the \"code\" from the form can be obtained using the requestParameters.get() method or serviceUtil.getFirstValue() method.\n\n\nCustom Properties\n#\n\n\nSometimes it is helpful to enable system administrators to\nenter properties that might change a lot.

Remember that selecting the  LDAP  method requires the script to be copied in the input box that appears upon LDAP selection:   Suggested Development Environment #  Gluu Server custom scripts are written in  Jython . It is recommended to use Eclipse for coding purposes.  Now, create some files:\n- A Python file for your script\n- One or more XHTML files if you have a custom form for your authentication\n- One or more XML files (you'll need one for each XHTML file) that provide some information to the Tomcat server about how to display the XHTML file.  Samples and Documentation #  There are many good examples of authentication interception scripts checked into Gluu's  oxAuth integrations folder . Also, the respective  XHTML  and  XML  files are checked in to the  auth folder .\nThe interfaces for the authentication interception can be found in the  Gluu Documentation .  We used the  Basic Script  \nas a template. The  Wikid forms  were also used as a template since it is required to pass the value of the \"code\" obtained from Twilio to step 2 of the authentication in order to validate and authenticate the user.  The  Wikid authentication  script was also looked upon quite a bit for examples on how to process the form.  Implement methods #  Simple example of how to add a custom template and how to pass values between 2 steps of authentication and save the value temporarily for authentication of a user.

Note: All three below custom properties are mandatory for the Twilio Two-Factor Authentication script to work   ACCOUNT_SID - Numerical sequence of numbers, to identify the token assigned to the user associated with Twilio.  AUTH TOKEN  - Alphanumerical number provided by Twilio for the account holder to identify the user.  FROM_NUMBER - Number which is either assigned by Twilio or can be a number user provides to send the code from.   As shown in the below illustration:   Methods #  authenticate():  The most important method to implement is obviously the  authenticate  method. This is where the main business logic is located for\nthe authentication workflow. It is possible to switch on the step, with the  if (step == 1):  statement. In oxAuth, there is no\nassumption that step 1 and step 2 happen on the same server, therefore the value stored in the LDAP using a temporarily created attribute and retrieved in step 2. There the step is sent into the  authenticate  method, which helps to save and retrieve the values whereever required.  Below are few Methods and Libraries used to Save the Value to LDAP and retrieve the values as per the requirement.  random.randit()  \nrandom.randit(\"start number\",\"\"end number\"), Generates the code as per designer or requirements. \nExample: random.randit(10000,99999)  context.set() \nThis particular method is obtained from jboss to pass the session attribute value to ldap, by creating a temporary attribute which has limited life time and can be retrieved within the life span, expires and session becomes invalid. Save the value of the code obtained through the code generator method. context.set(\"Name of the temp attribute\",  <key> ). Where  <key>  is the value that needs to be stored temporarily in ldap.\nExample:\ncontext.set(\"code\",code)  UserService.instance()  \nGets the user login instance  ServerUtil.getFirstValue():  To access  information from requestParameters in your script with  ServerUtil.getFirstValue(requestParameters, <key>)  where  <key> \nspecifies the value you want to retrieve, you can also use another method  requestParameters.get(\"<key>\") \nwhere  <key>  specifies the value you want to retrieve .  userService.getUserByAttribute():  getUserByAttribute(\"LDAP Attribute\", <key>)  method access the information in LDAP and retrieves the value of the attribute comparing the value of the  <Key> .\nExample:\nuserService.getUserByAttribute(\"uid\", user_name)  getAttribute(): \nTo retrieve the value of an attribute from LDAP, getAttribute(\"LDAP Attribute name\") can be used. \nExample:\ngetAttribute(\"mobile\")  requestParameters.get(): \nTo retrieve values passed from the form through header can be obtained by using the method requestParameters.get( <key> ). This will retrieve the values from the form via header and can be stored in a string. Where  <key>  is the value to be retrieved from header.\nExample:\nabc = requestParameters.get(\"passcode\")[0].strip()  getCountAuthenticationSteps():  Another method usually needed to implement is  getCountAuthenticationSteps . This method normally just returns 1, 2, or 3. If implementing an adaptive authentication strategy,\nwhere the number of steps depends on the context. Check out the\nDuo script for a good example of this. In our sample  Duo script ,  Duo Script was scripted only for those who wanted to use Duo\nfor the IT group. So this was checked for group membership, and dynamically adjusted the number of steps. And this can be scripted for any logic or attribute to the check the authentication, like \"country\" or \"region\".  getExtraParametersForStep():  If required to save session variables between steps, use the  getExtraParametersForStep  method. The Gluu Server persists\nthese variables in LDAP in able to support stateless clustered two\nstep authentications.  getPageForStep():  If required to display a special Web page for an interactive\nlogin, (or even a custom first page) you'll need to implement the getPageForStep  which specifies the page you want to return for a given\nstep.  session_attributes.get(): \nThe attribute value that are saved by the session using context.set. This method is derived from the oxauth core java libraries and called using the SessionState parameters which is defined in the code or programme.\nsession_attributes.get( <key> ), where  <key>  is the session atribute value that is stored in the ldap.\nExample:\nsession_attributes.get(\"code\")  Saving the value in LDAP and Passing values between two steps #  Saving Values: #  context.set  can be used to save values of the required key to an attribute temporarily and the created temporary attribute will be alive only for limited time and expires and gets removed, by that way, adding new attribute to the user is not messed up. And also the expired attribute kills the validity of the session and becomes invalid.  Retriving and passing values between the authentication steps: #  Using  session_attribute.get()  method, stored session attribute could be retrieved anywhere between the authentication method, by that way the values can be passed between two authentication methods for verification and validation.\nGenerated code and the entered \"code\" in the form can be verified using a simple if and the \"code\" from the form can be obtained using the requestParameters.get() method or serviceUtil.getFirstValue() method.  Custom Properties #  Sometimes it is helpful to enable system administrators to\nenter properties that might change a lot. If administrators are\nnot allowed to modify the script, Custom Property feature can be used, as illustrated in below screenshot:   configurationAttributes.get(\" \").getValue2\"():  To access this information in your script with  configurationAttributes.get(\"<key>\").getValue2() \nwhere  <key>  specifies the value you want to retrieve.  Returning a message to the user #  It is possible to use the Context to return a message to the\nuser, which could be especially useful if an error occurs, or if\nrequired to have some kind of user action.  Adding Libraries #  Pure Python libraries, can be added to  /opt/tomcat/conf/python , jar files can be added to  /var/gluu/webapps/oxauth/libs .  Note:  jar files should be added within chroot. And not in the main  /var/  of the system.  Testing #  When the scripting is done, you can test the script by print\nthe statments to wrapper.log under  /opt/tomcat/logs/wrapper.log .   And by prefix the logs, will help to find the script at ease\nusing tail command  tail -f | grep <prefix> , the prefix logs will\nprovide the script output while one trys to login using the script.  In the Twilio test script, a specific method called printOut  has been scripted to make it easier to add this prefix.  Also, remember that putting all the code in a  try / catch \nis a good practice to avoid unhandled exceptions. Since during\ndebugging, those exception may provide a hint pointing what causes the issue.  Further logs to debug and monitor the sequence can be done using oxauth_script.log and oxauth.log\nunder /opt/tomcat/logs/  which is within the chroot.  Reverting Authentication Method #  It is not unlikely that one may get locked out of Gluu\nServer, while testing the authentication script.  If there is any problem in it. In such a case the following\nmethod can be used to revert back the older authentication method.   As a secondary option, InPrivate or Incognito or Private Browser from various Browsers can be used.

In the \"pull\"\nmode, otherwise known as LDAP Synchronization or Cache Refresh, the Gluu\nServer can use an existing LDAP identity source like Microsoft Active\nDirectory as the authoritative source of identity information. If you\n\"push\" identities to the Gluu Server, you can use the JSON/REST SCIM\nAPI. Local user management can also be performed inside oxTrust. Each\nmethod is detailed below.\n\n\nLocal User Management\n#\n\n\nIn oxTrust, you can add, edit and manage people, groups and user\nattributes and claims to ensure the proper information is released about\nthe right people.\n\n\nPeople\n#\n\n\nTo manage people, navigate to User > Manage People, as shown in the\nscreenshot below.\n\n\n\n\nFrom this interface you can add users and search for specific users.\nBecause the user database can potentially be very large, a value is\nrequired in the search field. In other words, you can not click search\nwith a blank entry to populate all users. If you need to see all users,\nthis would be best performed manually within the Gluu OpenDJ server.\nUpon performing a user search, a list will be populated with all users\nthat match the search, as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\nTo edit a user, simply click on any of the hyperlinks associated with\nthat user and you will be taken to a user management interface where you\ncan modify that specific attributes relating to that user as displayed\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\nGroups\n#\n\n\nOut of the box, the Gluu Server includes one group: Gluu Server manager\ngroup, named: \u201cgluuManager\u201d. Groups can be added and populated as\nneeded. By using the \nManage Groups\n feature, the Gluu Server\nAdministrator can add, delete or modify any group or user within a\ngroup. The list of available groups can be viewed by hitting the\n\nSearch\n button with a blank search box.\n\n\n\nThe Gluu Server Administrator can modify information such as Display\nName, Group Owner, Visibility type etc. The Server Administrator can\nalso add or delete users within existing groups. The group information\nis represented as shown below.\n\n\n\nIf any member of the Organization is required to be added in any\nspecific group, this can be achieved be clicking on the Add Member\nbutton. The flow is \nAdd Member --> Search the name/email of the user\n--> Select the user --> Click OK --> Update.\n\n\n\n\nCache Refresh\n#\n\n\nCache Refresh is the process of connecting an existing backend LDAP server, like Microsoft Active Directory, with the Gluu Server's local LDAP server. Synching people and attributes from a backend server into the Gluu Server speeds up authentication transactions. It is possible to perform attribute transformations, changing the name of attributes, or even using an interception script to change the values. Transformations are stored in the Gluu LDAP service. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Run:\n The date and time of the latest cache refresh cycle\n  completion is shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdates at the Last Run:\n This shows the total number of users who\n  have been updated in the last Cache Refresh cycle. For example an user\n  who has any of his attribute updated will show up here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem at the Last Run:\n This shows the number of users who have\n  been rejected by the Gluu Server during the update. If there are any\n  rejections, please contact Gluu Support for clarification and help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomer Backend Key and Attributes\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Attribute:\n This is the unique key attribute of backend Active\n  Directory/LDAP Server such as SAMAccountname for any Active Directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject Class:\n This contains the Object Classes of the backend Active\n  Directory/LDAP which has permission to talk to Gluu Server Cache Refresh\n  such as person, organizationalPerson, user etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource Attribute:\n This contains the list of attributes which will be\n  pulled and read by the Gluu Server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom LDAP Filter:\n If there is any custom search required, this\nfiltering mechanism can be used such as \"sn=*\" whereas the value of this\nfield ensures that every user must contain an attribute named SN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource Backend LDAP Servers\n#\n\n\n\n\nThis section allows the Gluu Server to connect to the backend Active\nDirectory/LDAP server of the organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName:\n Please input \nsource\n as the value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Anonymous Bind:\n Some customers do now allow username/password\n  connections to their backend server. Enable this option if this applies\n  to your organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBind DN:\n This contains the username to connect to the backend\n  server. You need to use full DN here. As for example,\n  \ncn=gluu,dc=company,dc=org\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse SSL:\n Use this feature if the backend server allows SSL\n  connectivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMax Connections:\n This value defines the maximum number of\n  connections that are allowed to read the backend Active Directory/LDAP\n  server. It is recommended to keep the value of 2 or 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServer:\n This contains the backend Active Directory/LDAP server\n  hostname with port i.e. backend.organization.com:389. If organization\n  has a failover server, click \nAdd Server\n and add more hostnames with\n  port.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase DN:\n This contains the location of the Active Directory/LDAP\n  tree from where the Gluu Server shall read the user information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabled:\n This check-box is used to save and push the changes. Do not\n  use this unless the server administrator has entered all the required\n  values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange Bind Password:\n This can be used for a new password or to\n  change any existing password.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your organization has a multiple Active Directory/LDAP server, click\non \nAdd source LDAP server\n and add the additional server information.\nPlease remember that a \nfailover server\n is not a new server.\n\n\nInum LDAP Server\n#\n\n\n\n\nThis section of the application allows the server administrator to\nconnect to the internal LDAP of the Gluu Server. As Gluu Server\nadministrator, you do not need to insert anything here in this section\nas new Gluu Server versions automatically populates this for you (unless\nyou try to manually configure it anyway).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefresh Method:\n The Gluu Server allows the Server Administrator to\n  apply two types of Cache Refresh mechanism--(i) VDS Method and (ii) Copy\n  Method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVDS Method:\n Any organization with a database like \nmysql\n can use\n  the VDS method. This option can be enabled via the drop-down menu in\n  Refresh Method option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy Method:\n If the organization has any kind of Active\n  Directory/LDAP server, they are strongly recommended to use the \nCopy\n  Method\n from the drop-down menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttributes Mapping\n#\n\n\nWhen the Copy method is selected, a section for Attribute mapping will\nbe exposed. In this section, the Gluu Server Administrator can map any\nattribute from the backend Active Directory/LDAP to the LDAP cache of\nthe Gluu Server.\n\n\n\n\nIn the source attribute to destination attribute mapping field, you can\nenter the source attribute value on the left, and the destination\nattribute on the right. In other words, you can specify what the\nattribute is on the backend in the left field, and what it should be\nrendered as when it comes through the Gluu Server in the right field.\n\n\nThe Administrator can select any Cache Refresh Method according to the\nbackend Active Directory/LDAP server, but there are some essential\nvalues for both types of cache refresh method. The values are given\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPooling Interval (Minutes):\n This is the interval value for running\n    the Cache Refresh mechanism in the Gluu Server. It is recommended to \n    be kept higher than 15 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScript File Name:\n The Gluu Server cache refresh can accept any\n    kind of Jython Script which might help to calculate any custom/complex\n    attribute i.e. eduPersonScopedAffiliation. For more information please\n    contact Gluu Support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnapshot Folder:\n Every cycle of of Gluu Server Cache Refresh cycle\n    saves an overall snapshot and problem-list record on a specified\n    location. This is where the Gluu Server Administrator can specify the\n    location. You can easily decide whether cache refresh synchronizes all\n    users or not. Generally the rejected users are enclosed in the\n    problem-list file. An overall report is displayed at the top of the\n    cache refresh page with headings \nUpdated at the last run\n and\n    \nProblems at the last run\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnapshot Count:\n This defines the total number of snapshots that\n    are allowed to be saved in the hard drive of the VM. It is recommended\n    to be kept to 20 snapshots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Gluu Servers (including Community Edition) introduced two\nupgraded sections here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServer IP Address:\n Include the IP of your Gluu Server here. This\n    feature helps to run Cache Refresh mechanism perfectly in a clustered\n    environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoved Script File Name location:\n New version of the Gluu Server\n    allows the administrator to manage your custom scripts with more\n    interactive section under configuration named Manage Custom Scripts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate:\n This button is used to push the changes in the Gluu\n    Server. Hit this button only when the values have been entered,\n    completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate and Validate Script:\n This button is used to test the\n    operation and integrity of any custom script such as a Jython Script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImport People from file\n#\n\n\n\n\nGluu Server allows the administrator to add users from files. This can be accessed from the \nImport People\n button from the \nUsers\n menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \nAdd\n button to select the file from which the users will be imported. This feature has been tested with a \nxls\n file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe file needs to be validated before it can be imported. Click on the \nValidate\n button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \nImport\n button to complete the import of users.\n\n\n\n\nFile Scructure\n#\n\n\nThe file needs to contain the following fields from which the user data will be pulled. Please remember to use the exact spelling as shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsername\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegister User\n#\n\n\nSelf-Registration is done by users on a self-service basis. Since\noxTrust user registration cannot add users to a backend LDAP or Active\nDirectory server, self-registration will only be effective if GluuLDAP\nis used for authentication of users.\n\n\nBY default a a limited number of attribute is present in default\nself-registration form. If more attributes are needed they can be added\nin Registration Management of Organization Configuration\nThe oxTrust component provides a very basic user registration service for \nthe people to sign-up for an account on the Gluu Server. This service is \ndisabled by default. The \nUser Registration\n custom script  is used to enable the \nregistration feature.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWhen possible, we recommend handling user registration in your app locally, then pushing the information to the Gluu Server via SCIM 2.0. This will give you much more control and flexibility in defining the exact registration process. Also,\n\n\n\n\nfrequently oxTrust is not Internet facing--it was primarily designed as an interface for admins.\n\n\noxTrust Configuration\n#\n\n\nNavigate to the custom scripts section of the Admin Panel. Click on the \nConfiguration menu and then\nManage Custom Scripts`.\n\n\n\n\nThe tabs near the top of the page can be used to navigate to different custom scripts. We are concerned about \nthe \nUser Registration\n tab.\n\n\n\n\nSet the \nenable_user\n value to to \ntrue\n so that the user can login as soon as \nthe registration is complete, which sets the default status value. You may want to leave this to \nfalse\n if you \nwant to manually review user registrations before allowing them.\n\n\n\n\nClick \nEnable\n checkbox at the bottom of the page.\n\n\n\n\nUser Registration\n#\n\n\nThe users can register through the user registration link usually available at \n<hostname>/identity/register\n.\n\n\n\n\nSCIM 2.0 User Add/Delete\n#\n\n\nThis section outlines how to add/remove user from Gluu Server CE using \nSCIM-Client\n.\n\n\nAdd User\n#\n\n\nThere are two methods to add users:\n\n\n\n\nJSON Sting\n\n\nUser Object\n\n\n\n\nRequired Parameters\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuserName\n\n\nThe intended username for the end-user\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngivenName\n\n\nThe first name of the end-user\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfamilyName\n\n\nThe last name of the end-user\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndisplayName\n\n\nThe formatted first name followed by last name\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngroups\n\n\nOptional parameter if the user is added to any specific group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON String\n#\n\n\nThe user is added using a JSON object string using the required parameters; however it is possible to add more parameters.

Do not\n  use this unless the server administrator has entered all the required\n  values.    Change Bind Password:  This can be used for a new password or to\n  change any existing password.    If your organization has a multiple Active Directory/LDAP server, click\non  Add source LDAP server  and add the additional server information.\nPlease remember that a  failover server  is not a new server.  Inum LDAP Server #   This section of the application allows the server administrator to\nconnect to the internal LDAP of the Gluu Server. As Gluu Server\nadministrator, you do not need to insert anything here in this section\nas new Gluu Server versions automatically populates this for you (unless\nyou try to manually configure it anyway).    Refresh Method:  The Gluu Server allows the Server Administrator to\n  apply two types of Cache Refresh mechanism--(i) VDS Method and (ii) Copy\n  Method.    VDS Method:  Any organization with a database like  mysql  can use\n  the VDS method. This option can be enabled via the drop-down menu in\n  Refresh Method option.      Copy Method:  If the organization has any kind of Active\n  Directory/LDAP server, they are strongly recommended to use the  Copy\n  Method  from the drop-down menu.    Attributes Mapping #  When the Copy method is selected, a section for Attribute mapping will\nbe exposed. In this section, the Gluu Server Administrator can map any\nattribute from the backend Active Directory/LDAP to the LDAP cache of\nthe Gluu Server.   In the source attribute to destination attribute mapping field, you can\nenter the source attribute value on the left, and the destination\nattribute on the right. In other words, you can specify what the\nattribute is on the backend in the left field, and what it should be\nrendered as when it comes through the Gluu Server in the right field.  The Administrator can select any Cache Refresh Method according to the\nbackend Active Directory/LDAP server, but there are some essential\nvalues for both types of cache refresh method. The values are given\nbelow.    Pooling Interval (Minutes):  This is the interval value for running\n    the Cache Refresh mechanism in the Gluu Server. It is recommended to \n    be kept higher than 15 minutes.    Script File Name:  The Gluu Server cache refresh can accept any\n    kind of Jython Script which might help to calculate any custom/complex\n    attribute i.e. eduPersonScopedAffiliation. For more information please\n    contact Gluu Support.    Snapshot Folder:  Every cycle of of Gluu Server Cache Refresh cycle\n    saves an overall snapshot and problem-list record on a specified\n    location. This is where the Gluu Server Administrator can specify the\n    location. You can easily decide whether cache refresh synchronizes all\n    users or not. Generally the rejected users are enclosed in the\n    problem-list file. An overall report is displayed at the top of the\n    cache refresh page with headings  Updated at the last run  and\n     Problems at the last run .    Snapshot Count:  This defines the total number of snapshots that\n    are allowed to be saved in the hard drive of the VM. It is recommended\n    to be kept to 20 snapshots.    Latest Gluu Servers (including Community Edition) introduced two\nupgraded sections here.    Server IP Address:  Include the IP of your Gluu Server here. This\n    feature helps to run Cache Refresh mechanism perfectly in a clustered\n    environment.    Removed Script File Name location:  New version of the Gluu Server\n    allows the administrator to manage your custom scripts with more\n    interactive section under configuration named Manage Custom Scripts.    Update:  This button is used to push the changes in the Gluu\n    Server. Hit this button only when the values have been entered,\n    completely.    Update and Validate Script:  This button is used to test the\n    operation and integrity of any custom script such as a Jython Script.",

For example, by default oxAuth allows new clients to access to\ndefault scopes only. With a custom client registration interception\nscript it is possible to allow access to more scopes. For instance, we\ncan use \nredirect_uri\n to determine if we need to allow access to\nadditional scopes or not.\n\n\nTo access the interface for custom scripts in oxTrust, navigate to\nConfiguration --> Custom Scripts --> Custom Client Registration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe script is \navailable here",

This grant type\ncan eliminate the need for the client to store the resource owner\ncredentials for future use, by exchanging the credentials with a\nlong-lived access token or refresh token.\n\n\nThe flow is illustrated below:\n\n\n\n\nThe steps of the flow are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe application requests an access token from the authorization server, authenticating the request with its client credentials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the client credentials are successfully authenticated, an access token is returned to the client.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Should the Client Credentials Flow Be Used?\n#\n\n\nThe Client Credentials flow should be used when the resources of or any\napplication/service are stored externally in cloud storages such as\nGoogle Storage or Amazon S3 which can be accessed using API. In this\ncase the application needs to read and update these resources, but\nacting on behalf of the app itself rather than any individual user.\nThe application can ask the OAuth authorization server for an access\ntoken directly, without the involvement of any end user.\n\n\nExample Flow\n#\n\n\nThe following is an example showing the messages between the client and\nthe authorization server, also the example shows code fragments using\nthe oxAuth-Client.jar API to interact with the authorization server.\n\n\n// Parameters\nString tokenUrl = \"https://seed.gluu.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/token\";\n\n// Request\nTokenClient tokenClient = new TokenClient(tokenUrl);\nTokenResponse response = tokenClient.execClientCredentialsGrant(scope, clientId, clientSecret);\n\nint status response.getStatus(); // 200 if succeed\nString accessToken = response.getAccessToken();\nTokenType tokenType response.getTokenType(); // bearer\n\n\n\n\nThe message sent to the authorization server is:\n\n\n\n\nRequest\n\n\n\n\nPOST /oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/token HTTP/1.1\nHost: seed.gluu.org\nAuthorization: Basic QCExMTExITAwMDghRkY4MSEyRDM5OjYyMTNlOWI5LWM0NmQtNDAwOC04YWYxLTAzZjkxOGE4YWRlNA==\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\ngrant_type=client_credentials&scope=storage\n\n\n\n\nIf the client credentials are successfully authenticated, an access token is returned to the client.\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\n\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store, private\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{\"access_token\":\"c769d7ff-c476-42ab-b531-fe2f60b2f5cc\",\"token_type\":\"bearer\",\"expires_in\":3600}\n\n\n\n\nResource Owner Password Credentials Grant\n#\n\n\nThe resource owner password credentials (i.e. username and password) can\nbe used directly as an authorization grant to obtain an access token.\nThe credentials should only be used when there is a high degree of trust\nbetween the resource owner and the client (e.g. its device operating\nsystem or a highly privileged application), and when other authorization\ngrant types are not available (such as an authorization code).\n\n\nEven though this grant type requires direct client access to the\nresource owner credentials, the resource owner credentials are used for\na single request and are exchanged for an access token. This grant type\ncan eliminate the need for the client to store the resource owner\ncredentials for future use, by exchanging the credentials with a\nlong-lived access token or refresh token.\n\n\nThe flow is illustrated below:\n\n\n\n\nThe steps of the flow are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser presents their credentials to the application in addition to a username and password.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the client credentials are successfully authenticated, an access token is returned to the client\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Should the Resource Owner Password Flow Be Used?\n#\n\n\nThis flow should be used sparingly because the resource owner\u2019s password\nis exposed to the application. It is recommended only for first-party\n\u201cofficial\u201d applications released by the API provider, and not opened up\nto wider third-party developer communities. If a user is asked to type\ntheir password into \u201cofficial\u201d applications, they may become accustomed\nto doing so and become vulnerable to phishing attempts by other apps. In\norder to mitigate this concern, developers and IT administrators should\nclearly educate their users how they should determine which apps are\n\u201cofficial\u201d and which are not.\n\n\nSecurity Properties\n#\n\n\nThere are some security benefits to using this flow against\nauthenticating API calls with a username and password (via HTTP Basic\naccess authentication or similar) although the application has access to\nthe resource owner's password. With Basic authentication, an application\nneeds to have continuous access to the user\u2019s password in order to make\nAPI calls. If the user wants to revoke the access of the client, he must\nchange the password and re-enter the password in all the applications\nthat are allowed access to the resource.\n\n\nHowever, if the OAuth Resource Owner Password flow is used, the\napplication only needs access to the user\u2019s credentials once: on first\nuse when the credentials are exchanged for an access token. This means\nthere\u2019s no requirement for the app to store these credentials within the\napplication or on the device, and revoking access is easy as well.\n\n\nUser Experience\n#\n\n\nThe user experience for this flow is identical to typical password-based\naccess requests. The application asks the user for their username and\npassword and the user provides the information. The application then\nmakes either a server-side or client-side request to the API provider\u2019s\nauthorization server, without any user-facing interface changes. If the\nAPI provider does not issue a refresh_token and the issued access_token\nis short-lived, the application will likely store the username and\npassword for future authentication attempts. Unfortunately, this defeats\nsome of the benefit of this flow.\n\n\nExample Flow\n#\n\n\nThe following is an example showing the messages between the client and\nthe authorization server, also the example shows code fragments using\nthe oxAuth-Client.jar API to interact with the authorization server.\n\n\n// Parameters\nString tokenUrl = \"https://seed.gluu.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/token\";\n\n// Call the service\nTokenClient tokenClient = new TokenClient(tokenUrl);\nTokenResponse response = tokenClient.execResourceOwnerPasswordCredentialsGrant(username, password, scope, clientId, clientSecret);\n\n// Handle response\nint status = response.getStatus(); // 200 if succeed\nString accessToken = response.getAccessToken(); // 26d55e4b-6c61-40ea-9763-3282f5db0f0e\nTokenType tokenType = response.getTokenType(); // Enumeration: bearer\nString refreshToken = response.getRefreshToken(); // aba91bd9-aa10-4fca-952b-50a9a9afac28\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest\n\n\n\n\nPOST /oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/token HTTP/1.1\nHost: seed.gluu.org\nAuthorization: Basic QCExMTExITAwMDghRkY4MSEyRDM5OjYyMTNlOWI5LWM0NmQtNDAwOC04YWYxLTAzZjkxOGE4YWRlNA==\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\ngrant_type=password&scope=openid&username=mike&password=secret\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\n\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store, private\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{\"access_token\":\"26d55e4b-6c61-40ea-9763-3282f5db0f0e\",\"token_type\":\"bearer\",\"expires_in\":3599,\"refresh_token\":\"aba91bd9-aa10-4fca-952b-50a9a9afac28\",\"scope\":\"openid\",\"id_token\":\"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvc2VlZC5nbHV1Lm9yZyIsInVzZXJfaWQiOiJtaWtlIiwiYXVkIjoiQCExMTExITAwMDghRkY4MSEyRDM5IiwiZXhwIjoxMzM5MTk2ODgxMzAzLCJveEludW0iOiJAITExMTEhMDAwMCFENEU3Iiwib3hWYWxpZGF0aW9uVVJJIjoiaHR0cHM6XC9cL3NlZWQuZ2x1dS5vcmdcL294YXV0aFwvc2VhbVwvcmVzb3VyY2VcL3Jlc3R2MVwvb3hhdXRoXC9jaGVja19zZXNzaW9uIiwib3hPcGVuSURDb25uZWN0VmVyc2lvbiI6Im9wZW5pZGNvbm5lY3QtMS4wIn0.SzWfJsmlz62qTRw1lEJZ8PygY9eRupgmsbXLCQwPVDQ\"}\n\n\n\n\nGluu OAuth2 Access Management\n#\n\n\n[GAT][Gluu Access Token] is used for Gluu OAuth2 Access Management.\n\n\nOverview\n#\n\n\n\nCentralized Access Management needs a profile enabling a client ot obtain a token from the AS by explicitly specifyting the \nrequested scopes.\n\n\nGluu Access Token\n#\n\n\nGAT as plain json\n#\n\n\n{\n    \"exp\": 1256953732,\n    \"iat\": 1256912345,\n    \"scopes\" : {\n       \"view\", \"manage\"\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe [GAT][Gluu Access Token] is issued at a new endpoint which is published at \n<hostname>/.well-known/uma-configuration\n\n\nImportant:\n all requests/response to/from/between RP, RS, AS must contain \"GAT\" HTTP header with \"true\" value.

There is no perfect answer to logout that\nsatisfies all the requirements of all the domains on the Internet. For\nexample, large OpenID Providers, like Google, need a totally stateless\nimplementation--Google cannot track sessions on the server side for\nevery browser on the Internet. But in smaller domains, server side\nlogout functionality can be a convenient solution to cleaning up\nresources.\n\n\nThe OpenID Connect \nSession\nManagement\n is\nstill marked as draft, and new mechanisms for logout are in the works.\nThe current specification requires JavaScript to detect that the session\nhas been ended in the browser. It works... unless the tab with the\nJavaScript happens to be closed when the logout event happens on another\ntab. Also, inserting JavaScript into every page is not feasible for some\napplications. A new proposal is under discussion where the OpenID\nConnect logout API would return \nIMG\n HTML tags to the browser with the\nlogout callbacks of the clients. This way, the browser could call the\nlogout uris (not the server).\n\n\nThe Gluu Server is very flexible, and supports both server side session\nmanagement, and stateless session management. For server side business\nlogout, the domain admin can use Custom Logout scripts. This can be\nuseful to clean up sessions in a legacy SSO system (i.e. SiteMinder), or\nperhaps in a portal.\n\n\nThe key for logout is to understand the limitations of logout, and to\ntest the use cases that are important to you, so you will not be\nsurprised by the behavior when you put your application into production.\n\n\nTesting with oxAuth RP\n#\n\n\n\n\nGo to https://seed.gluu.org/oxauth-rp\n\n\nOr deploy \noxAuth-rp.war\n\n\n\n\nAuthorization Endpoint\n#\n\n\nRequest Authorization and receive the Authorization Code and ID Token\n#\n\n\n\n\nGo to https://seed.gluu.org/oxauth-rp\n\n\nEnter the Authorization Endpoint (eg: https://seed.gluu.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/authorize)\n\n\nSelect the Response Types: CODE and ID_TOKEN\n\n\nEnter the Client ID (eg: @!EDFB.879F.2DAE.D95A!0001!0442.B31E!0008!A2DA.C10F)\n\n\nSelect the desired scopes: OpenID is mandatory, profile, address,\n    email and phone are optional.\n\n\nEnter a Redirect uri, e.g. https://seed.gluu.org/oxauth-rp/home.seam\n\n\nOptionally enter a state value.\n\n\nClick submit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest Access Token using the Authorization Code\n#\n\n\n\n\nOnce redirected back to https://seed.gluu.org/oxauth-rp\n\n\nEnter the Token Endpoint (eg: https://seed.gluu.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/token)\n\n\nSelect the Grant Type: AUTHORIZATION_CODE\n\n\nEnter the Client ID.\n\n\nEnter the Client Secret.\n\n\nEnter the Code received from the previous request\n\n\nEnter the Redirect uri, e.g. https://seed.gluu.org/oxauth-rp/home.seam\n\n\nEnter the scopes: OpenID profile address email phone.\n\n\nClick submit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest new Access Token using the Refresh Token\n#\n\n\n\n\nGo to https://seed.gluu.org/oxauth-rp\n\n\nEnter the Token Endpoint (https://seed.gluu.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/token)\n\n\nSelect the Grant Type: REFRESH_TOKEN\n\n\nEnter the Client ID.\n\n\nEnter the Client Secret.\n\n\nEnter the Refresh Token received in a previous request.\n\n\nClick submit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUserInfo Endpoint\n#\n\n\n\n\nOpenID Connect Session Management\n#\n\n\nEnd Session Endpoint\n#\n\n\n\n\nCheck Session iFrame\n#",

            "text": "Logout is a catch-22. There is no perfect answer to logout that\nsatisfies all the requirements of all the domains on the Internet. For\nexample, large OpenID Providers, like Google, need a totally stateless\nimplementation--Google cannot track sessions on the server side for\nevery browser on the Internet. But in smaller domains, server side\nlogout functionality can be a convenient solution to cleaning up\nresources.  The OpenID Connect  Session\nManagement  is\nstill marked as draft, and new mechanisms for logout are in the works.\nThe current specification requires JavaScript to detect that the session\nhas been ended in the browser. It works... unless the tab with the\nJavaScript happens to be closed when the logout event happens on another\ntab. Also, inserting JavaScript into every page is not feasible for some\napplications. A new proposal is under discussion where the OpenID\nConnect logout API would return  IMG  HTML tags to the browser with the\nlogout callbacks of the clients. This way, the browser could call the\nlogout uris (not the server).  The Gluu Server is very flexible, and supports both server side session\nmanagement, and stateless session management. For server side business\nlogout, the domain admin can use Custom Logout scripts. This can be\nuseful to clean up sessions in a legacy SSO system (i.e. SiteMinder), or\nperhaps in a portal.  The key for logout is to understand the limitations of logout, and to\ntest the use cases that are important to you, so you will not be\nsurprised by the behavior when you put your application into production.",

If omitted, the default is that the Client will use only the code Response Type. Allowed values are code, token, id_token\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngrant_types\n\n\nA list of the OAuth 2.0 Grant Types that the Client is declaring that it will restrict itself to using. The Grant Type values used by OpenID Connect are:\nauthorization_code\nThe Authorization Code Grant Type\nimplicit\nThe Implicit Grant Type\nrefresh_token\nThe Refresh Token Grant Type\nThe following table lists the correspondence between response_type values that the Client will use and grant_type values that MUST be included in the registered grant_types list:\ncode: authorization_code\nid_token: implicit\ntoken id_token: implicit\ncode id_token: authorization_code, implicit\ncode token: authorization_code, implicit\ncode token id_token: authorization_code, implicit\n\n\n\n\n\n\napplication_type\n\n\nKind of the application. The default, if omitted, is web. The defined values are native or web. Web Clients using the OAuth Implicit Grant Type must only register URLs using the https scheme as redirect_uris; they must not use localhost as the hostname. Native Clients must only register redirect_uris using custom URI schemes or URLs using the http: scheme with localhost as the hostname.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontacts\n\n\ne-mail addresses of people responsible for this Client.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclient_name\n\n\nName of the Client to be presented to the End-User.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlogo_uri\n\n\nURL that references a logo for the Client application. If present, the server displays this image to the End-User during approval. The value of this field must point to a valid image file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclient_uri\n\n\nURL of the home page of the Client. The value of this field must point to a valid Web page. If present, the server displays this URL to the End-User in a followable fashion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npolicy_uri\n\n\nURL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-User to read about the how the profile data will be used. The value of this field must point to a valid web page. The OpenID Provider displays this URL to the End-User if it is given.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntos_uri\n\n\nURL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-User to read about the Relying Party's terms of service. The value of this field must point to a valid web page. The OpenID Provider displays this URL to the End-User if it is given.\n\n\n\n\n\n\njwks_uri\n\n\nURL for the Client's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document. If the Client signs requests to the Server, it contains the signing key(s) the Server uses to validate signatures from the Client. The JWK Set may also contain the Client's encryption keys(s), which are used by the Server to encrypt responses to the Client. When both signing and encryption keys are made available, a use (Key Use) parameter value is required for all keys in the referenced JWK Set to indicate each key's intended usage. Although some algorithms allow the same key to be used for both signatures and encryption, doing so is not recommended, as it is less secure. The JWK x5c parameter MAY be used to provide X.509 representations of keys provided. When used, the bare key values must still be present and must match those in the certificate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\njwks\n\n\nClient's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document, passed by value. The semantics of the jwks parameter are the same as the jwks_uri parameter, other than that the JWK Set is passed by value, rather than by reference. This parameter is intended only to be used by Clients that, for some reason, are unable to use the jwks_uri parameter, for instance, by native applications that might not have a location to host the contents of the JWK Set. If a Client can use jwks_uri, it must not use jwks. One significant downside of jwks is that it does not enable key rotation (which jwks_uri does). The jwks_uri and jwks parameters must not be used together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsector_identifier_uri\n\n\nURL using the https scheme to be used in calculating Pseudonymous Identifiers by the OP. The URL references a file with a single JSON array of redirect_uri values. Providers that use pairwise sub (subject) values utilizes the sector_identifier_uri value provided in the Subject Identifier calculation for pairwise identifiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubject_type\n\n\nsubject_type requested for responses to this Client. The subject_types_supported Discovery parameter contains a list of the supported subject_type values for this server. Valid types include pairwise and public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid_token_signed_response_alg\n\n\nJWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing the ID Token issued to this Client. The value none must not be used as the ID Token alg value unless the Client uses only Response Types that return no ID Token from the Authorization Endpoint (such as when only using the Authorization Code Flow). The default, if omitted, is RS256. The public key for validating the signature is provided by retrieving the JWK Set referenced by the jwks_uri element from OpenID Connect Discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid_token_encrypted_response_alg\n\n\nJWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If this is requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid_token_encrypted_response_enc\n\n\nJWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If id_token_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When id_token_encrypted_response_enc is included, id_token_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuserinfo_signed_response_alg\n\n\nJWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing UserInfo Responses. If this is specified, the response will be JWT serialized, and signed using JWS. The default, if omitted, is for the UserInfo Response to return the Claims as a UTF-8 encoded JSON object using the application/json content-type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuserinfo_encrypted_response_alg\n\n\nJWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If both signing and encryption are requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuserinfo_encrypted_response_enc\n\n\nJWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If userinfo_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When userinfo_encrypted_response_enc is included, userinfo_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_object_signing_alg\n\n\nJWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing Request Objects sent to the OP. All Request Objects from this Client are rejected, if not signed with this algorithm. This algorithm is used both when the Request Object is passed by value (using the request parameter) and when it is passed by reference (using the request_uri parameter). The value none may be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP may be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_object_encryption_alg\n\n\nJWE alg algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. This parameter should be included when symmetric encryption will be used, since this signals to the OP that a client_secret value needs to be returned from which the symmetric key will be derived, that might not otherwise be returned. The RP may still use other supported encryption algorithms or send unencrypted Request Objects, even when this parameter is present. If both signing and encryption are requested, the Request Object will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that the RP is not declaring whether it might encrypt any Request Objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_object_encryption_enc\n\n\nJWE enc algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. If request_object_encryption_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When request_object_encryption_enc is included, request_object_encryption_alg must also be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntoken_endpoint_auth_method\n\n\nRequested Client Authentication method for the Token Endpoint. The options are client_secret_post, client_secret_basic, client_secret_jwt, private_key_jwt, and none. If omitted, the default is client_secret_basic, the HTTP Basic Authentication Scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntoken_endpoint_auth_signing_alg\n\n\nJWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing the JWT used to authenticate the Client at the Token Endpoint for the private_key_jwt and client_secret_jwt authentication methods. All Token Requests using these authentication methods from this Client are rejected, if the JWT is not signed with this algorithm. The value none must not be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP MAY be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndefault_max_age\n\n\nDefault Maximum Authentication Age. Specifies that the End-User must be actively authenticated if the End-User was authenticated longer ago than the specified number of seconds. The max_age request parameter overrides this default value. If omitted, no default Maximum Authentication Age is specified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequire_auth_time\n\n\nBoolean value specifying whether the auth_time Claim in the ID Token is required. It is required when the value is true. (If this is false, the auth_time Claim can still be dynamically requested as an individual Claim for the ID Token using the claims request parameter) If omitted, the default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndefault_acr_values\n\n\nDefault requested Authentication Context Class Reference values. Array of strings that specifies the default acr values that the OP is being requested to use for processing requests from this Client, with the values appearing in order of preference. The Authentication Context Class satisfied by the authentication performed is returned as the acr Claim Value in the issued ID Token. The acr Claim is requested as a Voluntary Claim by this parameter. The acr_values_supported discovery element contains a list of the supported acr values supported by this server. Values specified in the acr_values request parameter or an individual acr Claim request override these default values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitiate_login_uri\n\n\nURI using the https scheme that a third party can use to initiate a login by the RP. The URI must accept requests via both GET and POST. The Client must understand the login_hint and iss parameters and should support the target_link_uri parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_uris\n\n\nrequest_uri values that are pre-registered by the RP for use at the OP. The Servers cache the contents of the files referenced by these URIs and not retrieve them at the time they are used in a request. OPs can require that request_uri values used be pre-registered with the require_request_uri_registration discovery parameter. If the contents of the request file could ever change, these URI values should include the base64url encoded SHA-256 hash value of the file contents referenced by the URI as the value of the URI fragment. If the fragment value used for a URI changes, that signals the server that its cached value for that URI with the old fragment value is no longer valid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n#\n\n\nClient Identificator or INUM, a client shared secret and the account expiration date in a [JSON[Response]]\n\n\nErrors\n#\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \nStatus Code|\nReason|\n    \n\n    \n\n            \n400|invalid_request\nThe request is missing a required parameter, includes an unsupported parameter or parameter value, repeats the same parameter, uses more than one method for including an access token, or is otherwise malformed.

possession of a permission ticket and an AAT for this\nauthorization server, the client asks the authorization server to give\nit authorization data corresponding to that permission ticket. It\nperforms a POST on the RPT endpoint, supplying its own AAT in the header\nand a JSON object in the body with a \"ticket\" property containing the\nticket as its value.\n\n\nIf the client had included an RPT in its failed access attempt, It MAY\nalso provide that RPT in an \"rpt\" property in its request to the\nauthorization server.\n\n\nIn circumstances where the client needs to provide requesting party\nclaims to the authorization server, it MAY also include a \"claim_tokens\"\nproperty in its request; see Section 3.4.1.2.1 for more information. The\nauthorization server uses the ticket to look up the details of the\npreviously registered requested permission, maps the requested\npermission to operative resource owner policies based on the resource\nset identifier and scopes associated with it, potentially requests\nadditional information, and ultimately responds positively or negatively\nto the request for authorization data.\n\n\nThe authorization server bases the issuing of authorization data on\nresource owner policies. These policies thus amount to an asynchronous\nOAuth authorization grant. The authorization server is also free to\nenable the resource owner to set policies that require the owner to\ninteract with the server in near-real time to provide consent subsequent\nto an access attempt. All such processes are outside the scope of this\nspecification.\n\n\nURL\n\n    http://gluu.org/requester/perm\n\n\nParameters\n\n- body\n\n\n|Parameter|Required|Description|Data Type|\n|body|false||\nRptAuthorizationRequest\n|\n- header\n\n\n|Parameter|Required|Description|Data Type|\n|Authorization|false||string|\n|Host|false||string|\n\n\nResponse\n\n\n\n\nErrors\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \nStatus Code|\nReason|\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n403|Forbidden.

This is done by sending the User Agent to the Authorization Server's Authorization Endpoint for Authentication and Authorization, using request parameters defined by OAuth 2.0 and additional parameters and parameter values defined by OpenID Connect.  URL #  http://<hostname of Gluu Server>/oxauth/authorize  Parameters #     Parameter  Required  Description  Data Type      scope  true  OpenID Connect requests MUST contain the openid scope value  string    response_type  true  OAuth 2.0 Response Type value that determines the authorization processing flow to be used,  including what parameters are returned from the endpoints used. When using the Authorization  Code Flow, this value is code  string    client_id  true  OAuth 2.0 Client Identifier valid at the Authorization Server.  string    redirect_uri  true  Redirection URI to which the response will be sent. This URI MUST exactly match one of the  Redirection URI values for the Client pre-registered at the OpenID Provider  string    state  false  Opaque value used to maintain state between the request and the callback.  Typically, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF, XSRF) mitigation is done by cryptographically binding  the value of this parameter with a browser cookie.  string    response_mode  false  This parameter informs the authorization server about the mechanism to be used to return  parameters from the authorization endpoint. This is not recommended if the default for  response_type is requested.  string    nonce  false  String value used to associate a Client session with an ID Token, and to mitigate replay attacks.  The value is passed through unmodified from the Authorization Request to the ID Token.  Sufficient entropy MUST be present in the nonce values used to prevent attackers from guessing  values.  string    display  false  ASCII string value that specifies how the Authorization Server displays the authentication  and consent user  interface pages to the end-user. The defined values are: page, popup, touch, wap  string    prompt  false  Space delimited, case sensitive list of ASCII string values that specifies whether the  Authorization Server prompts the end-user for re-authentication and consent.  The defined values are: none, login, consent, select_account  string    max_age  false  Maximum Authentication Age. Specifies the allowable elapsed time in seconds since the last  time the end-user was actively authenticated by the OP. If the elapsed  time is greater than this value, the OP MUST attempt to actively re-authenticate the end-user.  (The max_age request parameter corresponds to the OpenID 2.0 PAPE [OpenID.PAPE]  max_auth_age request parameter.) When max_age is used, the ID Token returned MUST include an  auth_time Claim Value.  int    ui_locales  false  end-user's preferred languages and scripts for the user interface, represented as a space-separated  list of BCP47 [RFC5646] language tag values, ordered by preference. For instance, the value \"fr-CA fr en\" represents a preference for French as spoken  in Canada, then French (without a region designation), followed by English (without a region designation). An error SHOULD NOT result if some or all of the requested  locales are not supported by the OpenID Provider.  string    id_token_hint  false  ID Token previously issued by the Authorization Server being passed as a hint about the end-user's  current or past authenticated session with the Client. If the end-user identified by the ID Token is logged in or is logged in by the request, then the Authorization  Server returns a positive response; otherwise, it SHOULD return an error, such as login_required. When possible, an id_token_hint SHOULD be present when prompt=none  is used and an invalid_request error MAY be returned if it is not; however, the server SHOULD respond successfully when possible, even if it is not present.  The Authorization Server need not be listed as an audience of the ID Token when it is used as an id_token_hint value.  string    login_hint  false  Hint to the Authorization Server about the login identifier the end-user might use to log in (if necessary).  This hint can be used by an RP if it first asks the end-user for their e-mail address (or other identifier) and then wants to pass that value as a hint to the discovered  authorization service. It is RECOMMENDED that the hint value match the value used for discovery. This value MAY also be a phone number in the format specified for the  phone_number Claim. The use of this parameter is left to the OP's discretion.  string    acr_values  false  Requested Authentication Context Class Reference values. Space-separated string that specifies the acr values that the  Authorization Server is being requested to use for processing this Authentication Request, with the values appearing in order of preference. The  Authentication Context Class satisfied by the authentication performed is returned as the acr Claim Value, as specified in Section 2. The acr Claim is requested as a  Voluntary Claim by this parameter.  string    amr_values  false  AMR Values  string    request  false  This parameter enables OpenID Connect requests to be passed in a single, self-contained parameter and to be optionally  signed and/or encrypted. The parameter value is a Request Object value, as specified in Section 6.1. It represents the request as a JWT whose Claims are the  request parameters.  string    request_uri  false  This parameter enables OpenID Connect requests to be passed by reference, rather than by value. The request_uri  value is a URL using the https scheme referencing a resource containing a Request Object value, which is a JWT containing the request parameters.  string    request_session_state  false  Request session state  string    sessionState  false  This is an optional parameter  string    accessToken  false  This parameter is optinal and carries the access token for the request.  string    origin_headers  false  This optional token is used in custom workflows.  string    codeChallange  false  This parameter allows the code to be challanced using PKCE.  string    codeChallangeMethod  false  This parameter allows the use of PKCE to challange code.  string    httpRequest  false  This is an optional parameter  string    securityContext  false  This is an injectable interface that provides access to security related information.  string      query   \n         \n             Parameter|Required|Description|Data Type|\n|response_mode|false|Informs the Authorization Server of the mechanism to be used for returning parameters from the Authorization Endpoint.

If present, the server displays this URL to the End-User in a followable fashion.    policy_uri  URL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-User to read about the how the profile data will be used. The value of this field must point to a valid web page. The OpenID Provider displays this URL to the End-User if it is given.    tos_uri  URL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-User to read about the Relying Party's terms of service. The value of this field must point to a valid web page. The OpenID Provider displays this URL to the End-User if it is given.    jwks_uri  URL for the Client's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document. If the Client signs requests to the Server, it contains the signing key(s) the Server uses to validate signatures from the Client. The JWK Set may also contain the Client's encryption keys(s), which are used by the Server to encrypt responses to the Client. When both signing and encryption keys are made available, a use (Key Use) parameter value is required for all keys in the referenced JWK Set to indicate each key's intended usage. Although some algorithms allow the same key to be used for both signatures and encryption, doing so is not recommended, as it is less secure. The JWK x5c parameter MAY be used to provide X.509 representations of keys provided. When used, the bare key values must still be present and must match those in the certificate.    jwks  Client's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document, passed by value. The semantics of the jwks parameter are the same as the jwks_uri parameter, other than that the JWK Set is passed by value, rather than by reference. This parameter is intended only to be used by Clients that, for some reason, are unable to use the jwks_uri parameter, for instance, by native applications that might not have a location to host the contents of the JWK Set. If a Client can use jwks_uri, it must not use jwks. One significant downside of jwks is that it does not enable key rotation (which jwks_uri does). The jwks_uri and jwks parameters must not be used together.    sector_identifier_uri  URL using the https scheme to be used in calculating Pseudonymous Identifiers by the OP. The URL references a file with a single JSON array of redirect_uri values. Providers that use pairwise sub (subject) values utilizes the sector_identifier_uri value provided in the Subject Identifier calculation for pairwise identifiers.    subject_type  subject_type requested for responses to this Client. The subject_types_supported Discovery parameter contains a list of the supported subject_type values for this server. Valid types include pairwise and public.    id_token_signed_response_alg  JWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing the ID Token issued to this Client. The value none must not be used as the ID Token alg value unless the Client uses only Response Types that return no ID Token from the Authorization Endpoint (such as when only using the Authorization Code Flow). The default, if omitted, is RS256. The public key for validating the signature is provided by retrieving the JWK Set referenced by the jwks_uri element from OpenID Connect Discovery.    id_token_encrypted_response_alg  JWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If this is requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.    id_token_encrypted_response_enc  JWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If id_token_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When id_token_encrypted_response_enc is included, id_token_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.    userinfo_signed_response_alg  JWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing UserInfo Responses. If this is specified, the response will be JWT serialized, and signed using JWS. The default, if omitted, is for the UserInfo Response to return the Claims as a UTF-8 encoded JSON object using the application/json content-type.    userinfo_encrypted_response_alg  JWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If both signing and encryption are requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.    userinfo_encrypted_response_enc  JWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If userinfo_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When userinfo_encrypted_response_enc is included, userinfo_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.    request_object_signing_alg  JWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing Request Objects sent to the OP. All Request Objects from this Client are rejected, if not signed with this algorithm. This algorithm is used both when the Request Object is passed by value (using the request parameter) and when it is passed by reference (using the request_uri parameter). The value none may be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP may be used.    request_object_encryption_alg  JWE alg algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. This parameter should be included when symmetric encryption will be used, since this signals to the OP that a client_secret value needs to be returned from which the symmetric key will be derived, that might not otherwise be returned. The RP may still use other supported encryption algorithms or send unencrypted Request Objects, even when this parameter is present. If both signing and encryption are requested, the Request Object will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that the RP is not declaring whether it might encrypt any Request Objects.    request_object_encryption_enc  JWE enc algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. If request_object_encryption_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When request_object_encryption_enc is included, request_object_encryption_alg must also be provided.    token_endpoint_auth_method  Requested Client Authentication method for the Token Endpoint. The options are client_secret_post, client_secret_basic, client_secret_jwt, private_key_jwt, and none. If omitted, the default is client_secret_basic, the HTTP Basic Authentication Scheme.    token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg  JWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing the JWT used to authenticate the Client at the Token Endpoint for the private_key_jwt and client_secret_jwt authentication methods. All Token Requests using these authentication methods from this Client are rejected, if the JWT is not signed with this algorithm. The value none must not be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP MAY be used.    default_max_age  Default Maximum Authentication Age. Specifies that the End-User must be actively authenticated if the End-User was authenticated longer ago than the specified number of seconds. The max_age request parameter overrides this default value. If omitted, no default Maximum Authentication Age is specified.    require_auth_time  Boolean value specifying whether the auth_time Claim in the ID Token is required. It is required when the value is true. (If this is false, the auth_time Claim can still be dynamically requested as an individual Claim for the ID Token using the claims request parameter) If omitted, the default value is false.    default_acr_values  Default requested Authentication Context Class Reference values. Array of strings that specifies the default acr values that the OP is being requested to use for processing requests from this Client, with the values appearing in order of preference. The Authentication Context Class satisfied by the authentication performed is returned as the acr Claim Value in the issued ID Token. The acr Claim is requested as a Voluntary Claim by this parameter. The acr_values_supported discovery element contains a list of the supported acr values supported by this server. Values specified in the acr_values request parameter or an individual acr Claim request override these default values.    initiate_login_uri  URI using the https scheme that a third party can use to initiate a login by the RP. The URI must accept requests via both GET and POST. The Client must understand the login_hint and iss parameters and should support the target_link_uri parameter.    request_uris  request_uri values that are pre-registered by the RP for use at the OP. The Servers cache the contents of the files referenced by these URIs and not retrieve them at the time they are used in a request. OPs can require that request_uri values used be pre-registered with the require_request_uri_registration discovery parameter. If the contents of the request file could ever change, these URI values should include the base64url encoded SHA-256 hash value of the file contents referenced by the URI as the value of the URI fragment. If the fragment value used for a URI changes, that signals the server that its cached value for that URI with the old fragment value is no longer valid.

It\nperforms a POST on the RPT endpoint, supplying its own AAT in the header\nand a JSON object in the body with a \"ticket\" property containing the\nticket as its value.  If the client had included an RPT in its failed access attempt, It MAY\nalso provide that RPT in an \"rpt\" property in its request to the\nauthorization server.  In circumstances where the client needs to provide requesting party\nclaims to the authorization server, it MAY also include a \"claim_tokens\"\nproperty in its request; see Section 3.4.1.2.1 for more information. The\nauthorization server uses the ticket to look up the details of the\npreviously registered requested permission, maps the requested\npermission to operative resource owner policies based on the resource\nset identifier and scopes associated with it, potentially requests\nadditional information, and ultimately responds positively or negatively\nto the request for authorization data.  The authorization server bases the issuing of authorization data on\nresource owner policies. These policies thus amount to an asynchronous\nOAuth authorization grant. The authorization server is also free to\nenable the resource owner to set policies that require the owner to\ninteract with the server in near-real time to provide consent subsequent\nto an access attempt.

An RPT is associated\nwith a set of authorization data that governs whether the client is\nauthorized for access.   The token's nature and format are dictated by its profile. The profile\nmight allow it to be self-contained, such that the resource server is\nable to determine its status locally, or might require or allow the\nresource server to make a run-time introspection request of the\nauthorization server that issued the token.  The endpoint MAY allow other parameters to provide further context to\nthe query. For instance, an authorization service may need to know the\nIP address of the client accessing the protected resource in order to\ndetermine the appropriateness of the token being presented.  To prevent unauthorized token scanning attacks, the endpoint MUST also\nrequire some form of authorization to access this endpoint, such as\nclient authentication as described in OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] or a separate\nOAuth 2.0 access token such as the bearer token described in OAuth 2.0\nBearer Token Usage [RFC6750].

            "location": "/admin-guide/custom-script/",
            "text": "Custom Script / Interception Script\n#\n\n\nGluu Server is very flexible by design enabling the use of \nJython\n interception scripts to customize behaviour. Jython was chosen because an interpreted language facilitates dynamic creation of business logic, and makes it easier to distribute this logic to a cluster of Gluu servers. Another advantage of Jython was that developers can use either Java or Python classes. Combined with the option of calling web services from Python or Java, this enables the Gluu Server to support any business-driven policy requirement.\n\n\nCustom Scripts can be accessed by navigating to Configuration \nand selecting the \nManage Custom Scritps\n tab.\n\n\n\n\nInterception Script Methods\n#\n\n\nThere are three methods that inherit a base interface\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInherited Methods\n\n\nMethod description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndef init(self, configurationAttributes)\n\n\nThis method is only called once during the script initialization. It can be used for global script initialization, initiate objects etc\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndef destroy(self, configurationAttributes)\n\n\nThis method is called once to destroy events. It can be used to free resource and objects created in the \ninit()\n method\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndef getApiVersion(self)\n\n\nThe \ngetApiVersion\n method allows API changes in order to do transparent migration from an old script to a new API. Currently all scripts should return \n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nconfigurationAttributes\n parameter is \njava.util.Map<String, SimpleCustomProperty>\n with properties specified in \noxConfigurationProperty\n attributes.\n\n\nThe script manager only loads enabled scripts. Hence, after enabling a\nscript, the script manager should trigger an event to either load or\ndestroy a script. All scripts are stored in LDAP in the\n\nou=scripts,o=<org_inum>,o=gluu\n branch.\n\n\nThis is a sample entry:\n\n\n    dn: inum=@!1111!031C.4A65,ou=scripts,o=@!1111,o=gluu\n    objectClass: oxCustomScript\n    objectClass: top\n    description: <custom_script_description>\n    displayName: <display_name>\n    gluuStatus: true\n    inum: @!1111!031C.4A65\n    oxLevel: <priority>\n    oxModuleProperty: {\"value1\":\"module_property_name\",\"value2\":\"module_property_value\",\"description\":\"\"}\n    oxConfigurationProperty: {\"value1\":\"configuration_property_name\",\"value2\":\"configuration_property_value\",\"description\":\"\"}\n    oxRevision: <revision>\n    oxScript: <custom_script>\n    oxScriptType: <script_type>\n    programmingLanguage: python\n\n\n\n\nThe script manager reloads scripts automatically without needing to\nrestart the application once \noxRevision\n is increased.\n\n\nInterception Script Logs\n#\n\n\nThe log files regarding interception scripts are not stored in the\n\nwrapper.log\n file. The logs are separated according to the module they\naffect. The oxAuth custom script logs are stored in \noxauth_script.log\n\nand the oxTrust custom script logs are stored in the\n\noxtrust_script.log\n. Please refer to these log files for any errors in\nthe interception scripts or following the workflow of the script.\n\n\nPerson Authentication\n#\n\n\nFor a list of pre-written, open source Gluu authentication scripts, view our \nserver integrations\n\n\nAn authentication script enables you to customize the user\nauthentication experience. For example, you can write a script that\nenables a two-factor authentication mechanism like Duo Security. By\ndefault oxAuth uses simple username/password authentication method. This\nscript type allows an admin to implement more secure workflows to cover\nan organizations security requirements. It extends the base script type\nwith the \ninit\n, \ndestroy\n and \ngetApiVersion\n methods but also adds the\nfollowing methods:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\n\nisValidAuthenticationMethod(self, usageType, configurationAttributes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis method is used to check if the authentication method is in a valid state. For example we can check there if a 3rd party mechanism is available to authenticate users. As a result it should either return \nTrue\n or \nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod Parameter\n\n\nusageType\n is \norg.xdi.model.AuthenticationScriptUsageType\nconfigurationAttributes\n is \njava.util.Map<String, SimpleCustomProperty>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\n\ndef getAlternativeAuthenticationMethod(self, usageType, configurationAttributes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis method is called only if the current authentication method is in an invalid state. Hence authenticator calls it only if \nisValidAuthenticationMethod\n returns False.

The hostname and the IP address is used in many settings stored in LDAP configuration entries, Apache/Jetty configuration and into the custom authentication script. It is strongly recommended to use a fresh install in a new VM. \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPlease use static IP address with reverse proxy or load balancer or simple port forwarding.\n\n\n\n\nHow to set the port to something other than 443\n#\n\n\nPorts other than 443 are not supported as the port is used by Apache Web Server. In theory, the change must reflect in the SAML and OpenID Connect metadata and still there might be errors.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPlease use a virtual ethernet interface and a different IP address on your server\n\n\n\n\nHow to customize IDP to ask for Email instead of username\n#\n\n\nIn oxTrust navigate to the Manage Authentication tab within the Configuration section. By default the Primary Key and Local Key are set to \nuid\n.

How to change the hostname/IP address/listening port of Gluu Server #  It is not recommended to change the hostname or IP address or the listening port of any installed Gluu Server instance. The hostname and the IP address is used in many settings stored in LDAP configuration entries, Apache/Jetty configuration and into the custom authentication script. It is strongly recommended to use a fresh install in a new VM.    Note  Please use static IP address with reverse proxy or load balancer or simple port forwarding.   How to set the port to something other than 443 #  Ports other than 443 are not supported as the port is used by Apache Web Server. In theory, the change must reflect in the SAML and OpenID Connect metadata and still there might be errors.   Note  Please use a virtual ethernet interface and a different IP address on your server   How to customize IDP to ask for Email instead of username #  In oxTrust navigate to the Manage Authentication tab within the Configuration section.
