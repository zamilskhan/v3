The requirements below are a bare minimum for Gluu CE to function properly. It is strongly recommended to allocate more resource for bigger backend data size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCPU Unit\n\n\nRAM\n\n\nDisk Space\n\n\nProcessor Type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n4GB\n\n\n40GB\n\n\n64 Bit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nThe processor type must be 64 bit for Gluu Server to function\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nInsufficient memory may cause unexpected errors and bugs which will require adjusting the resources for a smooth performance.\n\n\n\n\nPort\n#\n\n\nThe following ports open for the Gluu Server to run. Please keep the ports open before installing Gluu Server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPort Number\n\n\nProtocol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n80\n\n\ntcp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n443\n\n\ntcp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTomcat Memory Heap\n#\n\n\nThe minimum recommended heap for tomcat server is 3GB for a test instance of Gluu Server Community Edition (CE). This estimate is based on the minumum RAM requirements. It is best to keep this ratio when tomcat memory is allocated in production environments as the size will depend on the available RAM; as an example, a 6GB tomcat memory heap in a production server with 8 GB ram is ideal for a small organization running Gluu CE.\n\n\nFile Descriptor\n#\n\n\nGluu recommends setting the \nfile descriptors\n to 65k for Gluu Server CE. The following steps will help set the \nfile descriptor\n limit.\n\n\n\n\nEdit the \n/etc/security/limits.conf\n file.\n\n\nAdd the following lines in the \nlimits.conf\n file. Please replace the \nusername\n with the user that will install Gluu Server.\n\n\n\n\n* soft nofile 65536\n* hard nofile 262144\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the \n/etc/pam.d/login\n by adding the line:\n\n\n\n\nsession required pam_limits.so\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the system file limit to increase the file descriptor limit to 65535.

Azure assigns a new Public/Private IP\naddresses each time the server is started. \n\n\nSetting up VM\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog into Windows Azure Administrative Panel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on \nVirtual Machines\n tab, and click \nCreate a Virtual Machine\n link\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the menu, choose \nCompute\n --> \nVirtual Machine\n --> \nFrom Gallery\n branch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS or CentOS 6.7. Remember to set selinux\n   to permissive if you choose CentOS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvide a name for the VM in the \nVirtual Machine Name\n field and use\n\nStandard\n for \nTier\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect at least \nA2\n variant equipped with 3.5GB RAM in the \nSize\n\ndropdown menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvide an username to connect via ssh, and define an according\n   access password, or upload a certificate for an authentification\n   without passwords.

By default, only ssh tcp port 22 is there. The\n      public ports for http and https (tcp ports 80 and 443) have to be\n      added and mapped to the same private ports. If the cloud mappings\n      are flagged conflicting, proceed without setting them. Remember to\n      set them after the creation of the VM.

After the installation is complete, log in to the web-based interface with the username \nadmin\n and the \nLDAP superuser\n password. \n\n\nWelcome Page\n#\n\n\nThe administrator is taken to the welcome page if the username and the password is correct. Some basic information about the VM/server is displayed in the welcome screen. The version is displayed on top followed by free memory,disk space. The health of the VM/server can be easily determined from the welcome page. There is a photo icon on the right hand top side of the page which can be used to navigate to the user-profile and logging out of Gluu Server CE.\n\n\nThe menu on the left side of the welcome page is used to navigate the admin interface for Gluu Server. The menu has separate buttons for SAML, OpenID Connect and UMA. The user-management menu is found under \nUsers\n and the user-profile is under \nPersonal\n.\n\n\nConfiguration\n#\n\n\n\n\nThe configuration tab contians the tools to configure Gluu Server CE. This section is dedicated to all tuning and tinkering except integration tools.\nThe configuration menu is divided in to other sections which are revealed on click. The administrator can manage authentication, registration, attributes, cache-refresh,logs etc. from this menu.\n\n\nOrganization Configuration\n#\n\n\nThere are three sections in the organization configuration page which are \nSystem Configuration\n, \nSMTP Server Configuration\n and \nOxTrust Settings\n. These sections are detailed below with screenshots.\n\n\n\n\nSystem Configuration\n\nGluu Server CE is shipped with a built-in \nWhite Pages\n feature which can be enabled from the system configuration page. This page also contains the options to enable \nSelf-Service Password Reset\n which allows the Gluu Server users to reset their password via email. This options depends on the \nSMTP Server Configuration\n, also available under the organization configuration page. Additionally the \nSCIM Support\n can be enabled from the System Configuration page. If the organization uses any custom \nDNS Server(s)\n, the address should be updated from the System Configuration interface. \nMaximum Log Size (MB)*\n, by default Gluu UI will have 200 mb as the size of the log file and this value could be manipulated according to the administrator. Either this value could be increased or decreased depending on the HW specifications and contingency plan of the environment.\n\n\n\nSMTP Server Configuration\n\nThe mail server used by the Gluu Server to send notification to the pre-selected email address is configured in this page/panel. All the fields in this page are manadory and the configuration can be tested before confirmation. The fields are self-explanatory and simple such as hostname, user, password, ssl-requirement, authentication requirement, sending name and address.\n\n\n\nOxTrust Settings\n\nSome basic information abouht the administrator interface is available in this page. The administrator can find out the oxTrust build date and number by accessing the oxTrust settings page. The administrator can change the organization name, logo and favicon settings from this page as well. Finally oxTrust Settings page contains the name of the administrator group for Gluu Server. The users added in this group will have administrator access in Gluu Server where they will be able to maintain/configure the server.\n\n\n\n\nJSON Configuration\n#\n\n\nThe configuration files are accessible from the administrator interface (oxTrust). There are three tabs under the \nJSON Configuration\n menu\n\n\n\nThe oxtrust JSON configuration file is accessible from this tab and it can be edited from this page. The changes are updated by clicking on the \nUpdate\n button on the bottom of the page. \n\n\nThe oxAuth JSON configuration page gives easy access to the different endpoints used by Gluu Server CE. This page also contains the supported response, grants and algorithms among other information. The details will follow later on this documentation.\n\n\nThe oxTrust Import Person Configuration page contains the configuration for the file method of importing users into Gluu Server CE. The administrator can import users from a \nxls\n file which must be defined in this tab to import data in the LDAP attributes. The default format should contain the following fields\n\n\nManage Authentication\n#\n\n\nThe \nManage Authentication\n page contains the internal OpenDJ settings for Gluu Server CE. The \nDefault Authentication Method\n defines the authentication mechanism used for general authentication and oxTrust authentication. The separation is introduced because the users logging into Service Providers (SP) do not see the administrative console. The \noxTrust authentication mode\n decides the authentication mechasims for the users logging into the oxTrust admin interface.\n\n\n\nManage Custom Scripts\n#\n\n\nIt will not be an understatement to say that the custom script feature makes Gluu Server CE so robust and dynamic. The scripts are available for all intents and purposes the major being multi-factor authentication. There are many custom scritps included with the vanilla Gluu Server CE which can be enabled by clicking the check box.\n\n\n\n\nThe details about the custom scripts are given later in this guide.\n\n\nManage Registration\n#\n\n\nGluu Server CE is shiped with the feature to register users via the user-registration endpoint. The registry feature contains a Captcha which can be disabled from this page. Additionally it is possible to enable registration configuration from attributes.\n\n\nAttributes\n#\n\n\nThe attributes that are avalaible in the Gluu Server CE is found in this page. The administration can only see the active attributes when this page is accessed. The \nShow All Attributes\n button will show the inactive attributes too. Custom attributes can be added by clicking the \nAdd Attribute\n button and filling up a simple form. \n\n\n\n\nCache Refresh\n#\n\n\nCache Refresh is the mechanism used by Gluu Server CE to import users from a backend LDAP/AD data source. The entire configuration is handled from this page. The \nCache Refresh\n will notify the administrator of any problem with cache refresh the last time it was run. The frequency of cache refresh is also set from this page with the \nPolling interval (minutes)\n form. The key attributes, object class and the source attributes can be defined from the \nCustomer  BackendKey/Attributes\n tab. The backend server address, bind DN and other information must go to the \nSource Backend LDAP Servers\n tab.\n\n\nConfigure Log Viewer\n#\n\n\nThe logs for oxauth, oxtrust, cache refresh and the tomcat log can be configured from this tab. The log paths are given with the functionality to define any new log template with log file path.\n\n\nView Log File\n#\n\n\nThe log files are listed in the \nView Log File\n page under the \nAllowed Log Files\n tab. The individual logs can be tailed by clicking them. The \nConfiguration\n contains the last line count which will show the number of lines specified from the log in the \nTail of Log File\n tab. This section is an alternative to getting into the Gluu \nchroot\n and tailing the log files.\n\n\nServer Status\n#\n\n\nThis page will give some basic information about the Gluu Server such as the hostname, IP address, free memory & disk space. The number of users in the backend is also available in this page.\n\n\nCertificates\n#\n\n\nThe certificate page will give the certificate information for Gluu Server. The issuer info along with the algorithm used and the expiry date is also available.\n\n\nSAML\n#\n\n\nGluu Server CE contains all SAML related functionalities under the \nSAML\n tab divided into outbound and inbound SAML transactions. Inbound SAML is also known as ASIMBA. \n\n\nOutbound\n#\n\n\n\n\nThe \nTrust Relationships\n page, as the name suggests, will allow the administrator to view the created trust relationships (TRs) by searching using the search button. There is a button to add relationship with the same name. All the available TRs can be searched by using two (2) spaces in the search bar. There are some information that the administrator needs to gather before creating any new TR in Gluu Server. The metadata of the Service Provider (SP) connected using TR must be gathered along with the required attributes. The creation of TR will be covered in detail later.\n\n\nOpenID Connect\n#\n\n\nOpenID Connect is another protocol supported by Gluu Server CE following the \nopenID Connect specifications\n. The scopes page contains the \nAdd Scope\n button which can be used to add new scopes in Gluu Server. Additionally the available scopes can be searched by name or listed using two (2) spaces in the search bar.\n\n\n\n\nThe OpenID Connect clients are accessible from the \nClients\n page under \nOpenID Connect\n tab. The structure is similar to the scopes page with the functionality to search by name or use two (2) spaces to list all the available clients. New clients can be added by clicking the \nAdd Client\n button.\n\n\n\n\nUMA\n#\n\n\nUMA or (User-Managed Access) is an access management protocol supported by Gluu Server.The available scopes can be searched using the search bar on the top of the page. New scope descriptions can be added using the \nAdd Scope Description\n button.\n\n\n\nUMA resources page also has a searchbar on the top of the page and can be used to search for resource sets. New resource sets can be added by clocking on the \nAdd Resource Set\n button.\n\n\n\nUsers\n#\n\n\nUsers tab allows Gluu admin to do various task, including add admin, search users, Import users from file.\n\n\nPersonal\n#\n\n\nPersonal tab allows the individual person to view his basic profile and modify certain fields.",

There are two different flows of SAML known as outbound SAML and inbound SAML, both supported out-of-the-box in Gluu Server Community Edition (Gluu CE).\n\n\nSAML\n#\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an authentication and authorization protocol that defines the transaction process for XML-encoded assertions about authentication, authorization and attributes. The protocol is goverened by \nSecurity Assertion Markup Language Core\n(SAML) V2.0\n. The goal of this protocol is to exchange authentication and authorization data between Service Providers (SP) and the Identity Provider (IDP).\nGluu Server supports both inbound and outbound flow of SAML transaction. The oxTrutst administrator interface makes it easy to use SAML.\n\n\nTrust Relationships are the foundation on which SAML works. Gluu Server makes it easy to setup Trust Relationships from the oxTrust admin interface. There are two types of flow Gluu CE supports, inbound and outbound SAML.\nTrust Relationship creation is mandatory in both flows; however, the inbound flow also acts as a SAML proxy. The details about how to setup a Trust Relationship and how to setup SAML proxy follows later in this documentation. The image below is taken from wikipedia, showing a SAML transaction workflow.\n\n\n\n\nOpenID Connect\n#\n\n\n\n\nOpenID Connect\n is a standard profile of OAuth2 which defines a protocol to enable any website, mobile application to verify the identity of the user accessing its resources through an authorization server or identity server. The protocol is API friendly and works through endpoints making it easy for applications to use it. \n\n\nOpenID Connect specification consists of different documents which outline different aspects of the protocol. The basic implementation requires the \nOpenID Connect Core Specification\n. The figure below taken from the \nOpenID Connect website\n shows the overview of the protocol and the different parts of the specification.\n\n\n\n\nTerminology\n#\n\n\n\n\nClaim: Information about the entity\n\n\nID Token: JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains claims about the authentication\n\n\nIssuer: The authority that issues the claims\n\n\nOpenID Provider (OP): OAuth2.0 authorization server that authenticates user through claims to the Relying Party (RP)\n\n\nRelying Party (RP): OAuth 2.0 Client application that requires authentication and claims from an OpenID Provider(OP)\n\n\nUserInfo Endpoint: An URL using https that returns authorization for the user from the OP to the RP\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery\n#\n\n\nOpenID Connect provides a simple mechanism to notify about the available endpoints. This is difined in the \nOpenID Connect Discovery Specification\n. \n\n\nIn order for an OpenID Connect Relying Party (RP) to utilize OpenID Connect services for an End-User, the RP needs to know where the OpenID Provider is. OpenID Connect uses WebFinger to locate the OpenID Provider for an End-User.\nOnce the OpenID Provider has been identified, the configuration information for the OP is retrieved from a well-known location as a JSON document, including its OAuth 2.0 endpoint locations.\nIf you want to try a discovery request, you can make the following WebFinger request to discover the Issuer location:\n\n\nGET /.well-known/webfinger?resource=https%3A%2F%2Fidp.gluu.org&rel=http%3A%2F%2Fopenid.net%2Fspecs%2Fconnect%2F1.0%2Fissuer HTTP/1.1\nHost: idp.gluu.org\n\nHTTP/1.1 200\nContent-Type: application/jrd+json\n\n{\n    \"subject\": \"https://idp.gluu.org\",\n    \"links\": [{\n        \"rel\": \"http://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer\",\n        \"href\": \"https://idp.gluu.org\"\n    }]\n}\n\n\n\n\nUser-Managed Access (UMA)\n#\n\n\n\n\nUMA is an oAuth based protocol to \"enable a resource owner to control the authorization of data sharing and other protected-resource access made between online services on the owner\u2019s behalf or with the owner\u2019s authorization by an autonomous requesting party\"\n1\n.\n\n\nEnterprise UMA\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server implements UMA in a way that enables the protection of any web resource. Through the oxTrust interface, the server admin can write \ncustom authorization interception scripts\n which may contain logic to grant (or forbid) access. The diagram below shows an overview of the UMA Authorization workflow.\n\n\n\n\nTerminology\n#\n\n\n\n\nResource Server (RS): Where the resources are held. \n\n\nAuthorization Server (AS): A server that governs access based on resource owner policies. \n\n\nRequesting Party (RP): An end-user, or a corporation or other legal person, that uses a client to seek access to a protected resource. The requesting party may or may not be the same party as the resource owner. \n\n\nClient: A web or native app that is used to access a digital resource. \n\n\nProtection API Token (PAT): An entity seeking protection API access MUST have the scope \"uma_protection\". An access token with at least this scope is called a protection API token (PAT) and an entity that can acquire an access token with this scope is by definition a resource server. \n\n\nRequesting Party Token (RPT): the token that a client presents to a resource server when trying to access a protected resource. \n\n\nAuthorization API Token (AAT): An entity seeking authorization API access MUST have the scope \"uma_authorization\". An access token with at least this scope is called an authorization API token (AAT) and an entity that can acquire an access token with this scope is by definition a client.\n\n\n\n\nUMA Workflow\n#\n\n\nThe complete workflow sequence is shown in the diagram below. However there are two different authorization workflow given below for authorization and authorization token.\n\n\n\n\nAuthorization\n#\n\n\n\n\nAuthorization Token\n#\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery\n#\n\n\nGluu Server CE provides an endpoint for discovering information about UMA Provider configuration. A resource server or client can perform an HTTP GET on \nhttps://<hostname>/.well-known/uma-configuration\n to retrieve a JSON object indicating the UMA Provider configuration.\n\n\nThe following is an example of a GET request to the UMA configuration discovery endpoint:\n\n\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"issuer\": \"https://gluuserver.org\",\n  \"pat_profiles_supported\": [\n    \"bearer\"\n  ],\n  \"aat_profiles_supported\": [\n    \"bearer\"\n  ],\n  \"rpt_profiles_supported\": [\n    \"bearer\"\n  ],\n  \"pat_grant_types_supported\": [\n    \"authorization_code\"\n  ],\n  \"aat_grant_types_supported\": [\n    \"authorization_code\"\n  ],\n  \"claim_profiles_supported\": [\n    \"openid\"\n  ],\n  \"dynamic_client_endpoint\": \"https://gluuserver.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/register\",\n  \"token_endpoint\": \"https://gluuserver.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/token\",\n  \"user_endpoint\": \"https://gluuserver.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/authorize\",\n  \"introspection_endpoint\": \"https://gluuserver.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/host/status\",\n  \"resource_set_registration_endpoint\": \"https://gluuserver.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/host/rsrc\",\n  \"permission_registration_endpoint\": \"https://gluuserver.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/host/rsrc_pr\",\n  \"rpt_endpoint\": \"https://gluuserver.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/requester/rpt\",\n  \"authorization_request_endpoint\": \"https://gluuserver.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/requester/perm\",\n  \"scope_endpoint\": \"https://gluuserver.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/uma/scopes\"\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe UMA Response  may contain custom properties which are uniquely named for convenience and disguishing between standard & custom properties.\n\n\n\n\nOAuth2.0\n#\n\n\n\n\nOAuth2.0 is the next version in the OAuth protocol focusing on simplicity with specific authorization flows for different platforms. The core specification is called the \nOAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework\n. OAuth introduces an authorization layer and separates the role of the client from the resource owner. The resource is accessed using access tokens instead of credentials.\n\n\nTerminology\n#\n\n\n\n\nResource Owner (RO): Entity that owns and controls the access to any resource\n\n\nResource Server (RS): Where the resources are held\n\n\nClient: Any application/web-site that requests access to the protected resource stored in any RS.\n\n\nAuthorization Server: The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization\n\n\n\n\nWorkflows\n#\n\n\nCredentials Grant\n#\n\n\nThe Client Credentials Grant allows \nRO\n to use username and password as an authorization grant to obtain an access token. This flow is only encouraged when there is high degree of trust between \nRO\n and the client and no other grant types are not available.\n\n\nAlthough this grant requires direct client access to the \nRO\n credentials it is used for a single request for an access token.

A few confusing ones are listed below from the \nSCIM 2.0 Specs\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResource:  An artifact that is managed by a service provider and that\n      contains one or more attributes, e.g., \"User\" or \"Group\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResource Type:  A type of a resource that is managed by a service provider.  The\n      resource type defines the resource name, endpoint URL, schemas,\n      and other metadata that indicate where a resource is managed and\n      how it is composed, e.g., \"User\" or \"Group\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchema: A collection of attribute definitions that describe the contents of an entire or partial resource, e.g.,\n      \"urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe details of the SCIM API are given later in this documentation.",

The protocol is API friendly and works through endpoints making it easy for applications to use it.   OpenID Connect specification consists of different documents which outline different aspects of the protocol. The basic implementation requires the  OpenID Connect Core Specification . The figure below taken from the  OpenID Connect website  shows the overview of the protocol and the different parts of the specification.   Terminology #   Claim: Information about the entity  ID Token: JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains claims about the authentication  Issuer: The authority that issues the claims  OpenID Provider (OP): OAuth2.0 authorization server that authenticates user through claims to the Relying Party (RP)  Relying Party (RP): OAuth 2.0 Client application that requires authentication and claims from an OpenID Provider(OP)  UserInfo Endpoint: An URL using https that returns authorization for the user from the OP to the RP   Discovery #  OpenID Connect provides a simple mechanism to notify about the available endpoints. This is difined in the  OpenID Connect Discovery Specification .   In order for an OpenID Connect Relying Party (RP) to utilize OpenID Connect services for an End-User, the RP needs to know where the OpenID Provider is. OpenID Connect uses WebFinger to locate the OpenID Provider for an End-User.\nOnce the OpenID Provider has been identified, the configuration information for the OP is retrieved from a well-known location as a JSON document, including its OAuth 2.0 endpoint locations.\nIf you want to try a discovery request, you can make the following WebFinger request to discover the Issuer location:  GET /.well-known/webfinger?resource=https%3A%2F%2Fidp.gluu.org&rel=http%3A%2F%2Fopenid.net%2Fspecs%2Fconnect%2F1.0%2Fissuer HTTP/1.1\nHost: idp.gluu.org\n\nHTTP/1.1 200\nContent-Type: application/jrd+json\n\n{\n    \"subject\": \"https://idp.gluu.org\",\n    \"links\": [{\n        \"rel\": \"http://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer\",\n        \"href\": \"https://idp.gluu.org\"\n    }]\n}",

The basic terms like attribute, [SP][] are same across all the protocols. A few confusing ones are listed below from the  SCIM 2.0 Specs .    Resource:  An artifact that is managed by a service provider and that\n      contains one or more attributes, e.g., \"User\" or \"Group\".    Resource Type:  A type of a resource that is managed by a service provider.  The\n      resource type defines the resource name, endpoint URL, schemas,\n      and other metadata that indicate where a resource is managed and\n      how it is composed, e.g., \"User\" or \"Group\".    Schema: A collection of attribute definitions that describe the contents of an entire or partial resource, e.g.,\n      \"urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User\".    The details of the SCIM API are given later in this documentation.",

Here are some\n\ninstructions\n\nfor these steps.\n\n\nThe first thing you'll need to do is Create a Project on Google to obtain\nclient credentials. Click \"Create project\" and enter your desired\nproject name.\n\n\n\n\nThen click on your newly created project from the listing on the\ndashboard, and under the Credentials section, create a new \"OAuth2 2.0\nclient ID\". \n\n\n\n\nGoogle will ask you to configure your consent screen, to add your logo\nand other information displayed to the user to authorize Google to\nrelease information.\n\n\n\n\nFill out the form...\n\n\n\n\nNow you're ready to create the credentials. Enter \"Authorized JavaScript\norigins\". It should be the uri of your Gluu Server--for example\n\nhttps://idp.example.com\n.\n\n\n\n\nGoogle will display the client-id and the according secret ... ignore\nit. Instead, download the JSON file which you are going to upload into\nyour Gluu Server, next.\n\n\n\n\nMove this file to the location \n/opt/tomcat/conf/google.json\n. The JSON\nfile will look something like this example (no... these data are not\nvalid credentials!):\n\n\n{\n  \"web\": {\n    \"client_id\": \"7a64e55f-724d4e8c91823d5f1f18a0b2.apps.googleusercontent.com\",\n    \"auth_uri\": \"https:\\/\\/accounts.google.com\\/o\\/oauth2\\/auth\",\n    \"token_uri\": \"https:\\/\\/accounts.google.com\\/o\\/oauth2\\/token\",\n    \"auth_provider_x509_cert_url\": \"https:\\/\\/www.googleapis.com\\/oauth2\\/v1\\/certs\",\n    \"client_secret\": \"bb76a2c99be94e35b874\",\n    \"javascript_origins\": [\n    \"https:\\/\\/brookie.gluu.info\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe last step is to enable Google+ API's:\n\n\n\n\nNavigate back to the Google API \nconsole\n\n\nSelect project and enter project name\n\n\nOpen new project \"API & auth -> API\" menu item in configuration navigation tree\n\n\nClick \"Google+ API\"\n\n\nClick \"Enable API\" button\n\n\n\n\nConfigure oxTrust\n#\n\n\nFollow the steps below to configure the certificate authentication in the oxTrust Admin GUI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to Manage Custom Scripts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \nAdd Custom Scritp\n button\n\nadd-script-button\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill up the form and add the \nGoogle External Authenticator\n Script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll also need to add some custom properties:\n\n\n\n\ngplus_client_secrets_file\n: \n/opt/tomcat/conf/google.json\n\n\ngplus_deployment_type\n: enroll\n\n\ngplus_remote_attributes_list\n: email, given_name, family_name, and locale\n\n\n\n\ngplus_local_attributes_list\n: uid, mail, givenName, sn, cn, preferredLanguage\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngplus_client_secrets_file\n - It is a mandatory property that holds\n   the path to the application configuration file downloaded from Google\n   console for application. An example is \n/etc/certs/gplus_client_secrets.json\n.\n   These are the single steps needed to get it:\n    a) Log into: \nhttps://console.developers.google.com/project\n\n    b) Click \"Create project\" and enter project name\n    c) Open new project \"API & auth -> Credentials\" menu item in configuration navigation tree\n    d) Click \"Add credential\" with type \"OAuth 2.0 client ID\"\n    e) Select \"Web application\" application type\n    f) Enter \"Authorized JavaScript origins\". It should be CE server DNS\n       name, for example \nhttps://gluu.info\n.\n    g) Click \"Create\" and Click \"OK\" in next dialog\n    h) Click \"Download JSON\" in order to download\n       \ngplus_client_secrets.json\n file.\n    Also it is mandatory to enable Google+ API:\n    a) Log into \nhttps://console.developers.google.com/project\n\n    b) Select project and enter project name\n    c) Open new project \"API & auth -> API\" menu item in configuration navigation tree\n    d) Click \"Google+ API\"\n    e) Click \"Enable API\" button\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngplus_deployment_type\n - Specify the deployment mode. It is an\noptional property. If this property isn't specified the script tries to\nfind the user in the local LDAP by 'subject_identifier' claim specified\nin id_token. If this property has a 'map' value the script allows to map\n'subject_identifier' to the local user account. If this property has an\n'enroll' value the script adds a new user to the local LDAP with status\n'active'. In order to map the IDP attributes to the local attributes it\nuses properties from both gplus_remote_attributes_list and\ngplus_local_attributes_list. The allowed values are map and enroll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngplus_remote_attributes_list\n - Comma-separated list of attribute\nnames (user claims) that Google+ returns which map to local attributes\nin the \ngplus_local_attributes_list\n property. It is mandatory only if\n\ngplus_deployment_type\n is set to 'enroll'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngplus_local_attributes_list\n - Comma-separated list of Gluu Server\nLDAP attribute names that are mapped to Google user claims from the\n\ngplus_remote_attributes_list\n property. It is mandatory only if\n\ngplus_deployment_type\n is set to 'enroll'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nextension_module\n - Optional property to specify the full path of\nan external module that implements two methods:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    # This is called when the authentication script initializes\n    def init(conf_attr):\n        # Code here\n        return True/False\n\n    # This is called after authentication\n    def postLogin(conf_attr, user):\n        # Code here\n        return True    # or return False\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngplus_client_configuration_attribute\n - Optional property to\nspecify the client entry attribute name which can override\n\ngplus_client_secrets_file file\n content. It can be used in cases when\nall clients should use a separate \ngplus_client_secrets.json\n\nconfiguration.\n\n\n\n\nTesting\n#\n\n\nOne simple way to test the configuration is to use oxTrust. In the\n\"Configure Authentication\" dropdown menu, select \"Google\" (or whatever\nyou entered as the \"Name\" of the custom authentication script--as the\ndefault authentication method.\n\n\n\n\nAfter you login and logout, you should be presented with a new login\nform that has the Google login button:\n\n\n\n\nAfter clicking the Google login button, you are presented for\nauthorization--Google needs to make sure its ok to release attributes to\nthe Gluu Server:\n\n\n\n\nIf the script doesn't work, and you locked yourself out of oxTrust,\ndon't worry! You can create an LDIF file, for example \nrevert.ldif\n, to\nset back the default authentication method, like this:\n\n\ndn: inum=@!1E3B.F133.14FA.5062!0002!4B66.CF9C,ou=appliances,o=gluu\nchangetype: modify\nreplace: oxAuthenticationMode\noxAuthenticationMode: internal\n\n\n\n\noxAuthenticationMode corresponds to the 'Name' of the customer\nauthentication script in oxTrust. Use \ninternal\n to revert to the\ndefault LDAP authentication. You'll have to change the \ninum\n with the\n\ninum\n of your installation. You can find it using ldapsearch like this:\n\n\n/opt/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1389 -D \"cn=directory manager\" -j ~/.pw -b \"ou=appliances,o=gluu\" -s one \"objectclass=*\" inum\n\n\n\n\n~/.pw\n is a file with your Directory Manager password. If you don't\nremember it, try to find it using \ngrep\n: \n\n\ngrep ldapPass= /install/community-edition-setup/setup.properties.last\n\n\n\n\nOnce your LDIF looks ok, then use \nldapmodify\n to revert back to\npassword authentication:\n\n\n/opt/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -h localhost -p 1389 -D \"cn=directory manager\" -j ~/.pw -f revert.ldif\n\n\n\n\nIf things go wrong, it can leave the sessions in your browser in a bad\nstate. If things get really weird, remove the cookies in your browser\nfor the hostname of your Gluu Server.\n\n\nTwilio multi-factor Authentication - OTP using custom script\n#\n\n\nWriting a Custom Authentication Script\n#\n\n\nIn this document we walk through the steps of writing a script to implement OTP authentication using \nTwilio\n to send an SMS code for a two-step out-of-band authentication mechanism.\n\n\nAt the end of this tutorial you should have a better understanding of how to write your own custom scripts. For reference, you can review the completed Twilio custom authentication script \nhere\n. \n\n\nFields in Custom Script:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nName of the Script\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n[optional] Description about the script\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramming Language\n\n\nCurrently Python is supported, In future jscript and Java script might be added\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\n\n\nAuthentication Level for the authentication, which determines the security level\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation Type\n\n\nDetermines the script location. Can be stored in a \"File\" or could be stored in \"LDAP\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage Type\n\n\nDetermines the type of the usage. Web, Native or Both\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustome Property\n\n\nDetermines the key and value of the custom property, which can added to the authentication to pass the values\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScript Box\n\n\nScript Box will displayed if Location Type is selected as \"File\", to enter the path of the script\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScript\n\n\nScript Box will be displayed when Location Type is selected as \"LDAP\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom Script Location\n#\n\n\nCustom scripts can either be inserted directly into the Gluu Server interface or you can specify a path to the script. Specifying a path will make script development easier. There is also an option to revert back to a working script if the script is faulty or needs further enhancements. The administrator can select \nFile\n from the Script Location Type in oxTrust and the file input box will be displayed:\n\n\n\n\nThe 'LDAP' option in the Script Location Type can be used to store the script in the LDAP tree once the development is complete. Remember that selecting the \nLDAP\n method requires the script to be copied in the input box that appears upon LDAP selection:\n\n\n\n\nSuggested Development Environment\n#\n\n\nGluu Server custom scripts are written in \nJython\n. It is recommended to use Eclipse for coding purposes.\n\n\nNow, create some files:\n- A Python file for your script\n- One or more XHTML files if you have a custom form for your authentication\n- One or more XML files (you'll need one for each XHTML file) that provide some information to the Tomcat server about how to display the XHTML file.\n\n\nSamples and Documentation\n#\n\n\nThere are many good examples of authentication interception scripts checked into Gluu's\n\n\noxAuth integrations folder\n. Also, the respective \nXHTML\n and \nXML\n files are checked in to the \nauth folder\n.\nThe interfaces for the authentication interception can be found in the \nGluu Documentation\n.\n\n\nWe used the \nBasic Script\n \nas a template. The \nWikid forms\n were also used as a template since it is required to pass the value of the \"code\" obtained from Twilio to step 2 of the authentication in order to validate and authenticate the user.\n\n\nThe \nWikid authentication\n script was also looked upon quite a bit for examples on how to process the form.\n\n\nImplement methods\n#\n\n\nSimple example of how to add a custom template and how to pass values between 2 steps of authentication and save the value temporarily for authentication of a user. Our Sample \n\nTwilio script\n\n\n\n\nLogin to Gluu UI\n\n\nNavigate to \"Configuration\" on the Menu panel to the left\n\n\nSelect Manage Custom Scripts\n\n\nScroll to the end of the page and click on \"Add custom script configuration\"\n\n\nEnter the Name, Description, Programming Language (Python will be by default, may be in future Java or JavaSCript will be added)\n\n\nSelect the Level needed to set the security level to.\n\n\nSelect Location Type from the script to be executed.\n\n\nSelect the Usage Type required for the authentication.\n\n\nDefine Custom property which is provided by Twilio and can be noted down from Twilio account page of the signed up user. \n\n\nClick on Enabled to enable the added custom script.\n\n\nScroll down to the end of the update and click on Update button to submit the form. \n\n\nAfter the custom script is added, click on Manage Authenticaion on the Menu Panel to left. \n\n\nSelect \"Default Authentication Method\" tab and change the oxTrust authentication mode to \"Twilio\" or \"Name of the script\" from the drop down.\n\n\n\n\nNote: All three below custom properties are mandatory for the Twilio Two-Factor Authentication script to work\n\n\n\n\nACCOUNT_SID - Numerical sequence of numbers, to identify the token assigned to the user associated with Twilio.\n\n\nAUTH TOKEN  - Alphanumerical number provided by Twilio for the account holder to identify the user.\n\n\nFROM_NUMBER - Number which is either assigned by Twilio or can be a number user provides to send the code from.\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in the below illustration:\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n#\n\n\nauthenticate():\n\n\nThe most important method to implement is obviously the \nauthenticate\n method. This is where the main business logic is located for\nthe authentication workflow. It is possible to switch on the step, with the \nif (step == 1):\n statement. In oxAuth, there is no\nassumption that step 1 and step 2 happen on the same server, therefore the value stored in the LDAP using a temporarily created attribute and retrieved in step 2. There the step is sent into the \nauthenticate\n method, which helps to save and retrieve the values whereever required.\n\n\nBelow are few Methods and Libraries used to Save the Value to LDAP and retrieve the values as per the requirement.\n\n\nrandom.randit()\n \nrandom.randit(\"start number\",\"\"end number\"), Generates the code as per designer or requirements. \nExample: random.randit(10000,99999)\n\n\ncontext.set()\n\nThis particular method is obtained from jboss to pass the session attribute value to ldap, by creating a temporary attribute which has limited life time and can be retrieved within the life span, expires and session becomes invalid. Save the value of the code obtained through the code generator method. context.set(\"Name of the temp attribute\", \n<key>\n). Where \n<key>\n is the value that needs to be stored temporarily in ldap.\nExample:\ncontext.set(\"code\",code)\n\n\nUserService.instance()\n \nGets the user login instance\n\n\nServerUtil.getFirstValue():\n\n\nTo access  information from requestParameters in your script with \nServerUtil.getFirstValue(requestParameters, <key>)\n where \n<key>\n\nspecifies the value you want to retrieve, you can also use another method \nrequestParameters.get(\"<key>\")\n\nwhere \n<key>\n specifies the value you want to retrieve .\n\n\nuserService.getUserByAttribute():\n\n\ngetUserByAttribute(\"LDAP Attribute\", <key>)\n method access the information in LDAP and retrieves the value of the attribute comparing the value of the \n<Key>\n.\nExample:\nuserService.getUserByAttribute(\"uid\", user_name)\n\n\ngetAttribute():\n\nTo retrieve the value of an attribute from LDAP, getAttribute(\"LDAP Attribute name\") can be used. \nExample:\ngetAttribute(\"mobile\")\n\n\nrequestParameters.get():\n\nTo retrieve values passed from the form through header can be obtained by using the method requestParameters.get(\n<key>\n). This will retrieve the values from the form via header and can be stored in a string. Where \n<key>\n is the value to be retrieved from header.\nExample:\nabc = requestParameters.get(\"passcode\")[0].strip()\n\n\ngetCountAuthenticationSteps():\n\n\nAnother method usually needed to implement is \ngetCountAuthenticationSteps\n. This method normally just returns 1, 2, or 3. If implementing an adaptive authentication strategy,\nwhere the number of steps depends on the context. Check out the\nDuo script for a good example of this. In our sample \n\nDuo script\n,\n\n\nDuo Script was scripted only for those who wanted to use Duo\nfor the IT group. So this was checked for group membership, and dynamically adjusted the number of steps. And this can be scripted for any logic or attribute to the check the authentication, like \"country\" or \"region\".\n\n\ngetExtraParametersForStep():\n\n\nIf required to save session variables between steps, use the \ngetExtraParametersForStep\n method. The Gluu Server persists\nthese variables in LDAP in able to support stateless clustered two\nstep authentications.\n\n\ngetPageForStep():\n\n\nIf required to display a special Web page for an interactive\nlogin, (or even a custom first page) you'll need to implement the\n\ngetPageForStep\n which specifies the page you want to return for a given\nstep.\n\n\nsession_attributes.get():\n\nThe attribute value that are saved by the session using context.set. This method is derived from the oxauth core java libraries and called using the SessionState parameters which is defined in the code or programme.\nsession_attributes.get(\n<key>\n), where \n<key>\n is the session atribute value that is stored in the ldap.\nExample:\nsession_attributes.get(\"code\")\n\n\nSaving the value in LDAP and Passing values between two steps\n#\n\n\nSaving Values:\n#\n\n\ncontext.set\n can be used to save values of the required key to an attribute temporarily and the created temporary attribute will be alive only for limited time and expires and gets removed, by that way, adding new attribute to the user is not messed up. And also the expired attribute kills the validity of the session and becomes invalid.\n\n\nRetriving and passing values between the authentication steps:\n#\n\n\nUsing \nsession_attribute.get()\n method, stored session attribute could be retrieved anywhere between the authentication method, by that way the values can be passed between two authentication methods for verification and validation.\nGenerated code and the entered \"code\" in the form can be verified using a simple if and the \"code\" from the form can be obtained using the requestParameters.get() method or serviceUtil.getFirstValue() method.\n\n\nCustom Properties\n#\n\n\nSometimes it is helpful to enable system administrators to\nenter properties that might change a lot. If administrators are\nnot allowed to modify the script, Custom Property feature can be used, as illustrated in below screenshot:\n\n\n\n\nconfigurationAttributes.get(\"\n\").getValue2\"():\n\n\nTo access this information in your script with \n\nconfigurationAttributes.get(\"<key>\").getValue2()\n\nwhere \n<key>\n specifies the value you want to retrieve.\n\n\nReturning a message to the user\n#\n\n\nIt is possible to use the Context to return a message to the\nuser, which could be especially useful if an error occurs, or if\nrequired to have some kind of user action.\n\n\nAdding Libraries\n#\n\n\nPure Python libraries, can be added to \n/opt/tomcat/conf/python\n, jar files can be added to \n/var/gluu/webapps/oxauth/libs\n.\n\n\nNote:\n jar files should be added within chroot. And not in the main \n/var/\n of the system.\n\n\nTesting\n#\n\n\nWhen the scripting is done, you can test the script by print\nthe statments to wrapper.log under \n/opt/tomcat/logs/wrapper.log\n. \n\n\nAnd by prefix the logs, will help to find the script at ease\nusing tail command \ntail -f | grep <prefix>\n, the prefix logs will\nprovide the script output while one trys to login using the script.\n\n\nIn the Twilio test script, a specific method called\n\nprintOut\n has been scripted to make it easier to add this prefix.\n\n\nAlso, remember that putting all the code in a \ntry / catch\n\nis a good practice to avoid unhandled exceptions. Since during\ndebugging, those exception may provide a hint pointing what causes the issue.\n\n\nFurther logs to debug and monitor the sequence can be done using oxauth_script.log and oxauth.log\nunder\n/opt/tomcat/logs/\n which is within the chroot.\n\n\nReverting Authentication Method\n#\n\n\nIt is not unlikely that one may get locked out of Gluu\nServer, while testing the authentication script.\n\n\nIf there is any problem in it. In such a case the following\nmethod can be used to revert back the older authentication method. \n\n\nAs a secondary option, InPrivate or Incognito or Private Browser from various Browsers can be used.\n\n\nPlease see the \nFAQ\n for details.",

The first thing you'll need to do is Create a Project on Google to obtain\nclient credentials. Click \"Create project\" and enter your desired\nproject name.   Then click on your newly created project from the listing on the\ndashboard, and under the Credentials section, create a new \"OAuth2 2.0\nclient ID\".

It is an\noptional property. If this property isn't specified the script tries to\nfind the user in the local LDAP by 'subject_identifier' claim specified\nin id_token. If this property has a 'map' value the script allows to map\n'subject_identifier' to the local user account. If this property has an\n'enroll' value the script adds a new user to the local LDAP with status\n'active'. In order to map the IDP attributes to the local attributes it\nuses properties from both gplus_remote_attributes_list and\ngplus_local_attributes_list. The allowed values are map and enroll.    gplus_remote_attributes_list  - Comma-separated list of attribute\nnames (user claims) that Google+ returns which map to local attributes\nin the  gplus_local_attributes_list  property. It is mandatory only if gplus_deployment_type  is set to 'enroll'.    gplus_local_attributes_list  - Comma-separated list of Gluu Server\nLDAP attribute names that are mapped to Google user claims from the gplus_remote_attributes_list  property. It is mandatory only if gplus_deployment_type  is set to 'enroll'.    extension_module  - Optional property to specify the full path of\nan external module that implements two methods:        # This is called when the authentication script initializes\n    def init(conf_attr):\n        # Code here\n        return True/False\n\n    # This is called after authentication\n    def postLogin(conf_attr, user):\n        # Code here\n        return True    # or return False   gplus_client_configuration_attribute  - Optional property to\nspecify the client entry attribute name which can override gplus_client_secrets_file file  content. It can be used in cases when\nall clients should use a separate  gplus_client_secrets.json \nconfiguration.   Testing #  One simple way to test the configuration is to use oxTrust.

You can find it using ldapsearch like this:  /opt/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1389 -D \"cn=directory manager\" -j ~/.pw -b \"ou=appliances,o=gluu\" -s one \"objectclass=*\" inum  ~/.pw  is a file with your Directory Manager password. If you don't\nremember it, try to find it using  grep :   grep ldapPass= /install/community-edition-setup/setup.properties.last  Once your LDIF looks ok, then use  ldapmodify  to revert back to\npassword authentication:  /opt/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -h localhost -p 1389 -D \"cn=directory manager\" -j ~/.pw -f revert.ldif  If things go wrong, it can leave the sessions in your browser in a bad\nstate.

            "text": "Writing a Custom Authentication Script #  In this document we walk through the steps of writing a script to implement OTP authentication using  Twilio  to send an SMS code for a two-step out-of-band authentication mechanism.  At the end of this tutorial you should have a better understanding of how to write your own custom scripts. For reference, you can review the completed Twilio custom authentication script  here .

Specifying a path will make script development easier. There is also an option to revert back to a working script if the script is faulty or needs further enhancements. The administrator can select  File  from the Script Location Type in oxTrust and the file input box will be displayed:   The 'LDAP' option in the Script Location Type can be used to store the script in the LDAP tree once the development is complete. Remember that selecting the  LDAP  method requires the script to be copied in the input box that appears upon LDAP selection:   Suggested Development Environment #  Gluu Server custom scripts are written in  Jython . It is recommended to use Eclipse for coding purposes.  Now, create some files:\n- A Python file for your script\n- One or more XHTML files if you have a custom form for your authentication\n- One or more XML files (you'll need one for each XHTML file) that provide some information to the Tomcat server about how to display the XHTML file.  Samples and Documentation #  There are many good examples of authentication interception scripts checked into Gluu's  oxAuth integrations folder . Also, the respective  XHTML  and  XML  files are checked in to the  auth folder .\nThe interfaces for the authentication interception can be found in the  Gluu Documentation .  We used the  Basic Script  \nas a template. The  Wikid forms  were also used as a template since it is required to pass the value of the \"code\" obtained from Twilio to step 2 of the authentication in order to validate and authenticate the user.  The  Wikid authentication  script was also looked upon quite a bit for examples on how to process the form.  Implement methods #  Simple example of how to add a custom template and how to pass values between 2 steps of authentication and save the value temporarily for authentication of a user. Our Sample  Twilio script   Login to Gluu UI  Navigate to \"Configuration\" on the Menu panel to the left  Select Manage Custom Scripts  Scroll to the end of the page and click on \"Add custom script configuration\"  Enter the Name, Description, Programming Language (Python will be by default, may be in future Java or JavaSCript will be added)  Select the Level needed to set the security level to.  Select Location Type from the script to be executed.  Select the Usage Type required for the authentication.  Define Custom property which is provided by Twilio and can be noted down from Twilio account page of the signed up user.   Click on Enabled to enable the added custom script.  Scroll down to the end of the update and click on Update button to submit the form.   After the custom script is added, click on Manage Authenticaion on the Menu Panel to left.   Select \"Default Authentication Method\" tab and change the oxTrust authentication mode to \"Twilio\" or \"Name of the script\" from the drop down.   Note: All three below custom properties are mandatory for the Twilio Two-Factor Authentication script to work   ACCOUNT_SID - Numerical sequence of numbers, to identify the token assigned to the user associated with Twilio.  AUTH TOKEN  - Alphanumerical number provided by Twilio for the account holder to identify the user.  FROM_NUMBER - Number which is either assigned by Twilio or can be a number user provides to send the code from.   As shown in the below illustration:   Methods #  authenticate():  The most important method to implement is obviously the  authenticate  method. This is where the main business logic is located for\nthe authentication workflow. It is possible to switch on the step, with the  if (step == 1):  statement. In oxAuth, there is no\nassumption that step 1 and step 2 happen on the same server, therefore the value stored in the LDAP using a temporarily created attribute and retrieved in step 2. There the step is sent into the  authenticate  method, which helps to save and retrieve the values whereever required.  Below are few Methods and Libraries used to Save the Value to LDAP and retrieve the values as per the requirement.  random.randit()  \nrandom.randit(\"start number\",\"\"end number\"), Generates the code as per designer or requirements. \nExample: random.randit(10000,99999)  context.set() \nThis particular method is obtained from jboss to pass the session attribute value to ldap, by creating a temporary attribute which has limited life time and can be retrieved within the life span, expires and session becomes invalid. Save the value of the code obtained through the code generator method. context.set(\"Name of the temp attribute\",  <key> ). Where  <key>  is the value that needs to be stored temporarily in ldap.\nExample:\ncontext.set(\"code\",code)  UserService.instance()  \nGets the user login instance  ServerUtil.getFirstValue():  To access  information from requestParameters in your script with  ServerUtil.getFirstValue(requestParameters, <key>)  where  <key> \nspecifies the value you want to retrieve, you can also use another method  requestParameters.get(\"<key>\") \nwhere  <key>  specifies the value you want to retrieve .  userService.getUserByAttribute():  getUserByAttribute(\"LDAP Attribute\", <key>)  method access the information in LDAP and retrieves the value of the attribute comparing the value of the  <Key> .\nExample:\nuserService.getUserByAttribute(\"uid\", user_name)  getAttribute(): \nTo retrieve the value of an attribute from LDAP, getAttribute(\"LDAP Attribute name\") can be used. \nExample:\ngetAttribute(\"mobile\")  requestParameters.get(): \nTo retrieve values passed from the form through header can be obtained by using the method requestParameters.get( <key> ). This will retrieve the values from the form via header and can be stored in a string. Where  <key>  is the value to be retrieved from header.\nExample:\nabc = requestParameters.get(\"passcode\")[0].strip()  getCountAuthenticationSteps():  Another method usually needed to implement is  getCountAuthenticationSteps . This method normally just returns 1, 2, or 3. If implementing an adaptive authentication strategy,\nwhere the number of steps depends on the context. Check out the\nDuo script for a good example of this. In our sample  Duo script ,  Duo Script was scripted only for those who wanted to use Duo\nfor the IT group. So this was checked for group membership, and dynamically adjusted the number of steps. And this can be scripted for any logic or attribute to the check the authentication, like \"country\" or \"region\".  getExtraParametersForStep():  If required to save session variables between steps, use the  getExtraParametersForStep  method. The Gluu Server persists\nthese variables in LDAP in able to support stateless clustered two\nstep authentications.  getPageForStep():  If required to display a special Web page for an interactive\nlogin, (or even a custom first page) you'll need to implement the getPageForStep  which specifies the page you want to return for a given\nstep.  session_attributes.get(): \nThe attribute value that are saved by the session using context.set. This method is derived from the oxauth core java libraries and called using the SessionState parameters which is defined in the code or programme.\nsession_attributes.get( <key> ), where  <key>  is the session atribute value that is stored in the ldap.\nExample:\nsession_attributes.get(\"code\")  Saving the value in LDAP and Passing values between two steps #  Saving Values: #  context.set  can be used to save values of the required key to an attribute temporarily and the created temporary attribute will be alive only for limited time and expires and gets removed, by that way, adding new attribute to the user is not messed up. And also the expired attribute kills the validity of the session and becomes invalid.  Retriving and passing values between the authentication steps: #  Using  session_attribute.get()  method, stored session attribute could be retrieved anywhere between the authentication method, by that way the values can be passed between two authentication methods for verification and validation.\nGenerated code and the entered \"code\" in the form can be verified using a simple if and the \"code\" from the form can be obtained using the requestParameters.get() method or serviceUtil.getFirstValue() method.  Custom Properties #  Sometimes it is helpful to enable system administrators to\nenter properties that might change a lot. If administrators are\nnot allowed to modify the script, Custom Property feature can be used, as illustrated in below screenshot:   configurationAttributes.get(\" \").getValue2\"():  To access this information in your script with  configurationAttributes.get(\"<key>\").getValue2() \nwhere  <key>  specifies the value you want to retrieve.  Returning a message to the user #  It is possible to use the Context to return a message to the\nuser, which could be especially useful if an error occurs, or if\nrequired to have some kind of user action.  Adding Libraries #  Pure Python libraries, can be added to  /opt/tomcat/conf/python , jar files can be added to  /var/gluu/webapps/oxauth/libs .  Note:  jar files should be added within chroot. And not in the main  /var/  of the system.  Testing #  When the scripting is done, you can test the script by print\nthe statments to wrapper.log under  /opt/tomcat/logs/wrapper.log .   And by prefix the logs, will help to find the script at ease\nusing tail command  tail -f | grep <prefix> , the prefix logs will\nprovide the script output while one trys to login using the script.  In the Twilio test script, a specific method called printOut  has been scripted to make it easier to add this prefix.  Also, remember that putting all the code in a  try / catch \nis a good practice to avoid unhandled exceptions. Since during\ndebugging, those exception may provide a hint pointing what causes the issue.  Further logs to debug and monitor the sequence can be done using oxauth_script.log and oxauth.log\nunder /opt/tomcat/logs/  which is within the chroot.  Reverting Authentication Method #  It is not unlikely that one may get locked out of Gluu\nServer, while testing the authentication script.  If there is any problem in it. In such a case the following\nmethod can be used to revert back the older authentication method.   As a secondary option, InPrivate or Incognito or Private Browser from various Browsers can be used.  Please see the  FAQ  for details.",

            "text": "User Management in Gluu Server\n#\n\n\nTo keep the Gluu Server up-to-date with the latest user claims, your\norganization can either \"push\" or \"pull\" identity data. In the \"pull\"\nmode, otherwise known as LDAP Synchronization or Cache Refresh, the Gluu\nServer can use an existing LDAP identity source like Microsoft Active\nDirectory as the authoritative source of identity information. If you\n\"push\" identities to the Gluu Server, you can use the JSON/REST SCIM\nAPI. Local user management can also be performed inside oxTrust. Each\nmethod is detailed below.\n\n\nLocal User Management\n#\n\n\nIn oxTrust, you can add, edit and manage people, groups and user\nattributes and claims to ensure the proper information is released about\nthe right people.\n\n\nPeople\n#\n\n\nTo manage people, navigate to User > Manage People, as shown in the\nscreenshot below.\n\n\n\n\nFrom this interface you can add users and search for specific users.\nBecause the user database can potentially be very large, a value is\nrequired in the search field. In other words, you can not click search\nwith a blank entry to populate all users. If you need to see all users,\nthis would be best performed manually within the Gluu OpenDJ server.\nUpon performing a user search, a list will be populated with all users\nthat match the search, as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\nTo edit a user, simply click on any of the hyperlinks associated with\nthat user and you will be taken to a user management interface where you\ncan modify that specific attributes relating to that user as displayed\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\nGroups\n#\n\n\nOut of the box, the Gluu Server includes one group: Gluu Server manager\ngroup, named: \u201cgluuManager\u201d. Groups can be added and populated as\nneeded. By using the \nManage Groups\n feature, the Gluu Server\nAdministrator can add, delete or modify any group or user within a\ngroup. The list of available groups can be viewed by hitting the\n\nSearch\n button with a blank search box.\n\n\n\nThe Gluu Server Administrator can modify information such as Display\nName, Group Owner, Visibility type etc. The Server Administrator can\nalso add or delete users within existing groups. The group information\nis represented as shown below.\n\n\n\nIf any member of the Organization is required to be added in any\nspecific group, this can be achieved be clicking on the Add Member\nbutton. The flow is \nAdd Member --> Search the name/email of the user\n--> Select the user --> Click OK --> Update.\n\n\n\n\nCache Refresh\n#\n\n\nCache Refresh is the process of connecting an existing backend LDAP server, like Microsoft Active Directory, with the Gluu Server's local LDAP server. Synching people and attributes from a backend server into the Gluu Server speeds up authentication transactions. It is possible to perform attribute transformations, changing the name of attributes, or even using an interception script to change the values. Transformations are stored in the Gluu LDAP service. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Run:\n The date and time of the latest cache refresh cycle\n  completion is shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdates at the Last Run:\n This shows the total number of users who\n  have been updated in the last Cache Refresh cycle. For example an user\n  who has any of his attribute updated will show up here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem at the Last Run:\n This shows the number of users who have\n  been rejected by the Gluu Server during the update. If there are any\n  rejections, please contact Gluu Support for clarification and help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomer Backend Key and Attributes\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Attribute:\n This is the unique key attribute of backend Active\n  Directory/LDAP Server such as SAMAccountname for any Active Directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject Class:\n This contains the Object Classes of the backend Active\n  Directory/LDAP which has permission to talk to Gluu Server Cache Refresh\n  such as person, organizationalPerson, user etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource Attribute:\n This contains the list of attributes which will be\n  pulled and read by the Gluu Server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom LDAP Filter:\n If there is any custom search required, this\nfiltering mechanism can be used such as \"sn=*\" whereas the value of this\nfield ensures that every user must contain an attribute named SN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource Backend LDAP Servers\n#\n\n\n\n\nThis section allows the Gluu Server to connect to the backend Active\nDirectory/LDAP server of the organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName:\n Please input \nsource\n as the value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Anonymous Bind:\n Some customers do now allow username/password\n  connections to their backend server. Enable this option if this applies\n  to your organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBind DN:\n This contains the username to connect to the backend\n  server. You need to use full DN here. As for example,\n  \ncn=gluu,dc=company,dc=org\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse SSL:\n Use this feature if the backend server allows SSL\n  connectivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMax Connections:\n This value defines the maximum number of\n  connections that are allowed to read the backend Active Directory/LDAP\n  server. It is recommended to keep the value of 2 or 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServer:\n This contains the backend Active Directory/LDAP server\n  hostname with port i.e. backend.organization.com:389. If organization\n  has a failover server, click \nAdd Server\n and add more hostnames with\n  port.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase DN:\n This contains the location of the Active Directory/LDAP\n  tree from where the Gluu Server shall read the user information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabled:\n This check-box is used to save and push the changes. Do not\n  use this unless the server administrator has entered all the required\n  values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange Bind Password:\n This can be used for a new password or to\n  change any existing password.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your organization has a multiple Active Directory/LDAP server, click\non \nAdd source LDAP server\n and add the additional server information.\nPlease remember that a \nfailover server\n is not a new server.\n\n\nInum LDAP Server\n#\n\n\n\n\nThis section of the application allows the server administrator to\nconnect to the internal LDAP of the Gluu Server. As Gluu Server\nadministrator, you do not need to insert anything here in this section\nas new Gluu Server versions automatically populates this for you (unless\nyou try to manually configure it anyway).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefresh Method:\n The Gluu Server allows the Server Administrator to\n  apply two types of Cache Refresh mechanism--(i) VDS Method and (ii) Copy\n  Method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVDS Method:\n Any organization with a database like \nmysql\n can use\n  the VDS method. This option can be enabled via the drop-down menu in\n  Refresh Method option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy Method:\n If the organization has any kind of Active\n  Directory/LDAP server, they are strongly recommended to use the \nCopy\n  Method\n from the drop-down menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttributes Mapping\n#\n\n\nWhen the Copy method is selected, a section for Attribute mapping will\nbe exposed. In this section, the Gluu Server Administrator can map any\nattribute from the backend Active Directory/LDAP to the LDAP cache of\nthe Gluu Server.\n\n\n\n\nIn the source attribute to destination attribute mapping field, you can\nenter the source attribute value on the left, and the destination\nattribute on the right. In other words, you can specify what the\nattribute is on the backend in the left field, and what it should be\nrendered as when it comes through the Gluu Server in the right field.\n\n\nThe Administrator can select any Cache Refresh Method according to the\nbackend Active Directory/LDAP server, but there are some essential\nvalues for both types of cache refresh method. The values are given\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPooling Interval (Minutes):\n This is the interval value for running\n    the Cache Refresh mechanism in the Gluu Server. It is recommended to \n    be kept higher than 15 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScript File Name:\n The Gluu Server cache refresh can accept any\n    kind of Jython Script which might help to calculate any custom/complex\n    attribute i.e. eduPersonScopedAffiliation. For more information please\n    contact Gluu Support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnapshot Folder:\n Every cycle of of Gluu Server Cache Refresh cycle\n    saves an overall snapshot and problem-list record on a specified\n    location. This is where the Gluu Server Administrator can specify the\n    location. You can easily decide whether cache refresh synchronizes all\n    users or not. Generally the rejected users are enclosed in the\n    problem-list file. An overall report is displayed at the top of the\n    cache refresh page with headings \nUpdated at the last run\n and\n    \nProblems at the last run\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnapshot Count:\n This defines the total number of snapshots that\n    are allowed to be saved in the hard drive of the VM. It is recommended\n    to be kept to 20 snapshots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Gluu Servers (including Community Edition) introduced two\nupgraded sections here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServer IP Address:\n Include the IP of your Gluu Server here. This\n    feature helps to run Cache Refresh mechanism perfectly in a clustered\n    environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoved Script File Name location:\n New version of the Gluu Server\n    allows the administrator to manage your custom scripts with more\n    interactive section under configuration named Manage Custom Scripts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate:\n This button is used to push the changes in the Gluu\n    Server. Hit this button only when the values have been entered,\n    completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate and Validate Script:\n This button is used to test the\n    operation and integrity of any custom script such as a Jython Script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImport People from file\n#\n\n\n\n\nGluu Server allows the administrator to add users from files. This can be accessed from the \nImport People\n button from the \nUsers\n menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \nAdd\n button to select the file from which the users will be imported. This feature has been tested with a \nxls\n file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe file needs to be validated before it can be imported. Click on the \nValidate\n button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \nImport\n button to complete the import of users.\n\n\n\n\nFile Scructure\n#\n\n\nThe file needs to contain the following fields from which the user data will be pulled. Please remember to use the exact spelling as shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsername\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegister User\n#\n\n\nSelf-Registration is done by users on a self-service basis. Since\noxTrust user registration cannot add users to a backend LDAP or Active\nDirectory server, self-registration will only be effective if GluuLDAP\nis used for authentication of users.\n\n\nBY default a a limited number of attribute is present in default\nself-registration form. If more attributes are needed they can be added\nin Registration Management of Organization Configuration\nThe oxTrust component provides a very basic user registration service for \nthe people to sign-up for an account on the Gluu Server. This service is \ndisabled by default. The \nUser Registration\n custom script  is used to enable the \nregistration feature.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWhen possible, we recommend handling user registration in your app locally, then pushing the information to the Gluu Server via SCIM 2.0. This will give you much more control and flexibility in defining the exact registration process. Also,\n\n\n\n\nfrequently oxTrust is not Internet facing--it was primarily designed as an interface for admins.\n\n\noxTrust Configuration\n#\n\n\nNavigate to the custom scripts section of the Admin Panel. Click on the \nConfiguration menu and then\nManage Custom Scripts`.\n\n\n\n\nThe tabs near the top of the page can be used to navigate to different custom scripts.

Synching people and attributes from a backend server into the Gluu Server speeds up authentication transactions. It is possible to perform attribute transformations, changing the name of attributes, or even using an interception script to change the values. Transformations are stored in the Gluu LDAP service.      Last Run:  The date and time of the latest cache refresh cycle\n  completion is shown here.    Updates at the Last Run:  This shows the total number of users who\n  have been updated in the last Cache Refresh cycle. For example an user\n  who has any of his attribute updated will show up here.    Problem at the Last Run:  This shows the number of users who have\n  been rejected by the Gluu Server during the update. If there are any\n  rejections, please contact Gluu Support for clarification and help.     Customer Backend Key and Attributes #     Key Attribute:  This is the unique key attribute of backend Active\n  Directory/LDAP Server such as SAMAccountname for any Active Directory.    Object Class:  This contains the Object Classes of the backend Active\n  Directory/LDAP which has permission to talk to Gluu Server Cache Refresh\n  such as person, organizationalPerson, user etc.    Source Attribute:  This contains the list of attributes which will be\n  pulled and read by the Gluu Server.    Custom LDAP Filter:  If there is any custom search required, this\nfiltering mechanism can be used such as \"sn=*\" whereas the value of this\nfield ensures that every user must contain an attribute named SN.    Source Backend LDAP Servers #   This section allows the Gluu Server to connect to the backend Active\nDirectory/LDAP server of the organization.    Name:  Please input  source  as the value.    Use Anonymous Bind:  Some customers do now allow username/password\n  connections to their backend server. Enable this option if this applies\n  to your organization.    Bind DN:  This contains the username to connect to the backend\n  server. You need to use full DN here. As for example,\n   cn=gluu,dc=company,dc=org .    Use SSL:  Use this feature if the backend server allows SSL\n  connectivity.    Max Connections:  This value defines the maximum number of\n  connections that are allowed to read the backend Active Directory/LDAP\n  server. It is recommended to keep the value of 2 or 3.    Server:  This contains the backend Active Directory/LDAP server\n  hostname with port i.e. backend.organization.com:389. If organization\n  has a failover server, click  Add Server  and add more hostnames with\n  port.    Base DN:  This contains the location of the Active Directory/LDAP\n  tree from where the Gluu Server shall read the user information.    Enabled:  This check-box is used to save and push the changes. Do not\n  use this unless the server administrator has entered all the required\n  values.    Change Bind Password:  This can be used for a new password or to\n  change any existing password.    If your organization has a multiple Active Directory/LDAP server, click\non  Add source LDAP server  and add the additional server information.\nPlease remember that a  failover server  is not a new server.  Inum LDAP Server #   This section of the application allows the server administrator to\nconnect to the internal LDAP of the Gluu Server. As Gluu Server\nadministrator, you do not need to insert anything here in this section\nas new Gluu Server versions automatically populates this for you (unless\nyou try to manually configure it anyway).    Refresh Method:  The Gluu Server allows the Server Administrator to\n  apply two types of Cache Refresh mechanism--(i) VDS Method and (ii) Copy\n  Method.    VDS Method:  Any organization with a database like  mysql  can use\n  the VDS method. This option can be enabled via the drop-down menu in\n  Refresh Method option.      Copy Method:  If the organization has any kind of Active\n  Directory/LDAP server, they are strongly recommended to use the  Copy\n  Method  from the drop-down menu.    Attributes Mapping #  When the Copy method is selected, a section for Attribute mapping will\nbe exposed. In this section, the Gluu Server Administrator can map any\nattribute from the backend Active Directory/LDAP to the LDAP cache of\nthe Gluu Server.   In the source attribute to destination attribute mapping field, you can\nenter the source attribute value on the left, and the destination\nattribute on the right. In other words, you can specify what the\nattribute is on the backend in the left field, and what it should be\nrendered as when it comes through the Gluu Server in the right field.  The Administrator can select any Cache Refresh Method according to the\nbackend Active Directory/LDAP server, but there are some essential\nvalues for both types of cache refresh method. The values are given\nbelow.    Pooling Interval (Minutes):  This is the interval value for running\n    the Cache Refresh mechanism in the Gluu Server. It is recommended to \n    be kept higher than 15 minutes.    Script File Name:  The Gluu Server cache refresh can accept any\n    kind of Jython Script which might help to calculate any custom/complex\n    attribute i.e. eduPersonScopedAffiliation. For more information please\n    contact Gluu Support.    Snapshot Folder:  Every cycle of of Gluu Server Cache Refresh cycle\n    saves an overall snapshot and problem-list record on a specified\n    location. This is where the Gluu Server Administrator can specify the\n    location. You can easily decide whether cache refresh synchronizes all\n    users or not. Generally the rejected users are enclosed in the\n    problem-list file. An overall report is displayed at the top of the\n    cache refresh page with headings  Updated at the last run  and\n     Problems at the last run .    Snapshot Count:  This defines the total number of snapshots that\n    are allowed to be saved in the hard drive of the VM. It is recommended\n    to be kept to 20 snapshots.    Latest Gluu Servers (including Community Edition) introduced two\nupgraded sections here.    Server IP Address:  Include the IP of your Gluu Server here. This\n    feature helps to run Cache Refresh mechanism perfectly in a clustered\n    environment.    Removed Script File Name location:  New version of the Gluu Server\n    allows the administrator to manage your custom scripts with more\n    interactive section under configuration named Manage Custom Scripts.    Update:  This button is used to push the changes in the Gluu\n    Server. Hit this button only when the values have been entered,\n    completely.

In an outbound SAML transaction, the SP redirects the user to the designated Identity Provider (IDP) for authentication and authorization. The IDP will ask for the username and password for the user and up on successful authentication, the user is sent back to the SP logged in. The requirement for the IDP is a trust relationship (TR) set up beforehand with the SP. The next section covers how to set up a TR in Gluu Server.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor any SAML transaction, a trust relationship must be created with the IDP.\n\n\n\n\nTrust Relationship Requirements\n#\n\n\nTrust Relationship requires the infomation listed below.\n\n\nMetadata of the SP\n\nMetadata is a XML file which has configuration data used to provision any website (SP) or IDP (Gluu Server) to communicate with each other. It is interchangeable between the IDP and the SP.\n\n\nWebsites (SP) can provide metadata via URL or as a separate file.\n\n\nRequired Attributes\n\nEvery organization has their own policy to release/share attributes with\nany IDP or SP. The oxTrust GUI supports both preconfigured and custom attribute\nRelease to the SP. The administrator only needs to click on the desired \nattribute and it will be released to the SP.\n\n\nSSO Testing Endpoint\n\nEvery website (SP) should have both a staging and a production URI\nendpoint which can be checked for SSO, where the user will access to log\ninto that SP.\n\n\nCreate a Trust Relationship\n#\n\n\n\n\nGo to SAML \u2192 Trust Relationships\n\n\nClick on \u201cAdd Relationship\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new page will appear. Here, as a Gluu Server administrator you need\n  to provide all the information regarding the SP to establish Trust\n  Relationship from Gluu Server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay Name\n: Name of the Trust Relationship (it should be unique for every trust relationship)\n\n\nDescription\n: Little description. Purpose and SSO link can be added here.\n\n\nMetadata Type\n: Depending on trusted party\u2019s metadata (SP), there are four available types in Gluu Server\n\n\nFile\n: If SP has uploadable metadata in XML format, this option works best.\n\n\nURI\n: If the metadata of SP has URI link and accessible from the internet, Gluu Server Administrator can use this option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReleased\n: The attributes that are required for the SP must be in this pane. The required attributes can be selected from the left side pane with the heading \u201cRelease Additional Attributes\u201d.\nThe TR is added by clicking on the \nAdd\n button located in the lower left side of the page.\n\n\n\n\nRelying Party Configuration\n#\n\n\nThe Relying Party must be configured for some SPs. The relying party configuration is accessible on the TR Creation page. The checkbox \nConfigure specific Relying Party\n must be checked.\n\n\n\n\nThe checkbox will result in a link which can be accessed to configure relying party for the TR. The image below shows the relying party config panel from which the administrator can add the specific option.\n\n\n\n\nFederation Configuration\n#\n\n\nIf the SP is part of any identity federation such as InCommon Federation, then the administrator must add the federation as a SP in Gluu Server. This will allow the administrator to add SPs under the federation easily from a TR. The requirement of a federation TR created using the general TR is a must. The example below shows an administrator adding a TR for InCommon Federation.\n\n\n\n\nOnce this is done, the SPs under the federation can be added by selecting the Federation from the \nFederation Name\n drop down menu and selecting the entity-id for the SP.\n\n\n\n\nInbound SAML\n#\n\n\nGluu Server uses an open source product called Asimba to achieve inbound SAML. Asimba allows websites to use a single IDP for SSO even when the organization has multiple trusted IDPs. Please see the \nAsimba website\n for more information.\n\n\nGluu Server is shipped with the SAML Script which simplifies the process of using SAML Proxy. The SAML proxy configuration is made easy from the oxTrust admin interface. This section provides a step-by-step method of configuring the proxy with two (2) IDPs and a single SP.

            "text": "Outbound SAML can also be called SP-initiated Single Sign On (SSO) or traditional SAML. In an outbound SAML transaction, the SP redirects the user to the designated Identity Provider (IDP) for authentication and authorization. The IDP will ask for the username and password for the user and up on successful authentication, the user is sent back to the SP logged in. The requirement for the IDP is a trust relationship (TR) set up beforehand with the SP. The next section covers how to set up a TR in Gluu Server.   Note  For any SAML transaction, a trust relationship must be created with the IDP.   Trust Relationship Requirements #  Trust Relationship requires the infomation listed below.  Metadata of the SP \nMetadata is a XML file which has configuration data used to provision any website (SP) or IDP (Gluu Server) to communicate with each other. It is interchangeable between the IDP and the SP.  Websites (SP) can provide metadata via URL or as a separate file.  Required Attributes \nEvery organization has their own policy to release/share attributes with\nany IDP or SP. The oxTrust GUI supports both preconfigured and custom attribute\nRelease to the SP. The administrator only needs to click on the desired \nattribute and it will be released to the SP.  SSO Testing Endpoint \nEvery website (SP) should have both a staging and a production URI\nendpoint which can be checked for SSO, where the user will access to log\ninto that SP.  Create a Trust Relationship #   Go to SAML \u2192 Trust Relationships  Click on \u201cAdd Relationship\u201d     A new page will appear. Here, as a Gluu Server administrator you need\n  to provide all the information regarding the SP to establish Trust\n  Relationship from Gluu Server.     Display Name : Name of the Trust Relationship (it should be unique for every trust relationship)  Description : Little description. Purpose and SSO link can be added here.  Metadata Type : Depending on trusted party\u2019s metadata (SP), there are four available types in Gluu Server  File : If SP has uploadable metadata in XML format, this option works best.  URI : If the metadata of SP has URI link and accessible from the internet, Gluu Server Administrator can use this option.    Released : The attributes that are required for the SP must be in this pane. The required attributes can be selected from the left side pane with the heading \u201cRelease Additional Attributes\u201d.\nThe TR is added by clicking on the  Add  button located in the lower left side of the page.   Relying Party Configuration #  The Relying Party must be configured for some SPs. The relying party configuration is accessible on the TR Creation page. The checkbox  Configure specific Relying Party  must be checked.   The checkbox will result in a link which can be accessed to configure relying party for the TR. The image below shows the relying party config panel from which the administrator can add the specific option.   Federation Configuration #  If the SP is part of any identity federation such as InCommon Federation, then the administrator must add the federation as a SP in Gluu Server. This will allow the administrator to add SPs under the federation easily from a TR. The requirement of a federation TR created using the general TR is a must. The example below shows an administrator adding a TR for InCommon Federation.   Once this is done, the SPs under the federation can be added by selecting the Federation from the  Federation Name  drop down menu and selecting the entity-id for the SP.",

            "text": "Client Credentials Grant\n#\n\n\nThe Client Credentials Grant allows resource owner to use password\ncredentials (i.e. username and password) as an authorization grant to\nobtain an access token. The credentials should only be used when there\nis a high degree of trust between the resource owner and the client\n(e.g. its device operating system or a highly privileged application),\nand when other authorization grant types are not available (such as an\nauthorization code).\n\n\nEven though this grant type requires direct client access to the\nresource owner credentials, the resource owner credentials are used for\na single request and are exchanged for an access token. This grant type\ncan eliminate the need for the client to store the resource owner\ncredentials for future use, by exchanging the credentials with a\nlong-lived access token or refresh token.\n\n\nThe flow is illustrated below:\n\n\n\n\nThe steps of the flow are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe application requests an access token from the authorization server, authenticating the request with its client credentials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the client credentials are successfully authenticated, an access token is returned to the client.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Should the Client Credentials Flow Be Used?\n#\n\n\nThe Client Credentials flow should be used when the resources of or any\napplication/service are stored externally in cloud storages such as\nGoogle Storage or Amazon S3 which can be accessed using API. In this\ncase the application needs to read and update these resources, but\nacting on behalf of the app itself rather than any individual user.\nThe application can ask the OAuth authorization server for an access\ntoken directly, without the involvement of any end user.\n\n\nExample Flow\n#\n\n\nThe following is an example showing the messages between the client and\nthe authorization server, also the example shows code fragments using\nthe oxAuth-Client.jar API to interact with the authorization server.\n\n\n// Parameters\nString tokenUrl = \"https://seed.gluu.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/token\";\n\n// Request\nTokenClient tokenClient = new TokenClient(tokenUrl);\nTokenResponse response = tokenClient.execClientCredentialsGrant(scope, clientId, clientSecret);\n\nint status response.getStatus(); // 200 if succeed\nString accessToken = response.getAccessToken();\nTokenType tokenType response.getTokenType(); // bearer\n\n\n\n\nThe message sent to the authorization server is:\n\n\n\n\nRequest\n\n\n\n\nPOST /oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/token HTTP/1.1\nHost: seed.gluu.org\nAuthorization: Basic QCExMTExITAwMDghRkY4MSEyRDM5OjYyMTNlOWI5LWM0NmQtNDAwOC04YWYxLTAzZjkxOGE4YWRlNA==\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\ngrant_type=client_credentials&scope=storage\n\n\n\n\nIf the client credentials are successfully authenticated, an access token is returned to the client.\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\n\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store, private\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{\"access_token\":\"c769d7ff-c476-42ab-b531-fe2f60b2f5cc\",\"token_type\":\"bearer\",\"expires_in\":3600}\n\n\n\n\nResource Owner Password Credentials Grant\n#\n\n\nThe resource owner password credentials (i.e. username and password) can\nbe used directly as an authorization grant to obtain an access token.\nThe credentials should only be used when there is a high degree of trust\nbetween the resource owner and the client (e.g. its device operating\nsystem or a highly privileged application), and when other authorization\ngrant types are not available (such as an authorization code).\n\n\nEven though this grant type requires direct client access to the\nresource owner credentials, the resource owner credentials are used for\na single request and are exchanged for an access token. This grant type\ncan eliminate the need for the client to store the resource owner\ncredentials for future use, by exchanging the credentials with a\nlong-lived access token or refresh token.\n\n\nThe flow is illustrated below:\n\n\n\n\nThe steps of the flow are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser presents their credentials to the application in addition to a username and password.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the client credentials are successfully authenticated, an access token is returned to the client\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Should the Resource Owner Password Flow Be Used?\n#\n\n\nThis flow should be used sparingly because the resource owner\u2019s password\nis exposed to the application. It is recommended only for first-party\n\u201cofficial\u201d applications released by the API provider, and not opened up\nto wider third-party developer communities. If a user is asked to type\ntheir password into \u201cofficial\u201d applications, they may become accustomed\nto doing so and become vulnerable to phishing attempts by other apps. In\norder to mitigate this concern, developers and IT administrators should\nclearly educate their users how they should determine which apps are\n\u201cofficial\u201d and which are not.\n\n\nSecurity Properties\n#\n\n\nThere are some security benefits to using this flow against\nauthenticating API calls with a username and password (via HTTP Basic\naccess authentication or similar) although the application has access to\nthe resource owner's password. With Basic authentication, an application\nneeds to have continuous access to the user\u2019s password in order to make\nAPI calls. If the user wants to revoke the access of the client, he must\nchange the password and re-enter the password in all the applications\nthat are allowed access to the resource.\n\n\nHowever, if the OAuth Resource Owner Password flow is used, the\napplication only needs access to the user\u2019s credentials once: on first\nuse when the credentials are exchanged for an access token. This means\nthere\u2019s no requirement for the app to store these credentials within the\napplication or on the device, and revoking access is easy as well.\n\n\nUser Experience\n#\n\n\nThe user experience for this flow is identical to typical password-based\naccess requests. The application asks the user for their username and\npassword and the user provides the information. The application then\nmakes either a server-side or client-side request to the API provider\u2019s\nauthorization server, without any user-facing interface changes. If the\nAPI provider does not issue a refresh_token and the issued access_token\nis short-lived, the application will likely store the username and\npassword for future authentication attempts. Unfortunately, this defeats\nsome of the benefit of this flow.\n\n\nExample Flow\n#\n\n\nThe following is an example showing the messages between the client and\nthe authorization server, also the example shows code fragments using\nthe oxAuth-Client.jar API to interact with the authorization server.\n\n\n// Parameters\nString tokenUrl = \"https://seed.gluu.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/token\";\n\n// Call the service\nTokenClient tokenClient = new TokenClient(tokenUrl);\nTokenResponse response = tokenClient.execResourceOwnerPasswordCredentialsGrant(username, password, scope, clientId, clientSecret);\n\n// Handle response\nint status = response.getStatus(); // 200 if succeed\nString accessToken = response.getAccessToken(); // 26d55e4b-6c61-40ea-9763-3282f5db0f0e\nTokenType tokenType = response.getTokenType(); // Enumeration: bearer\nString refreshToken = response.getRefreshToken(); // aba91bd9-aa10-4fca-952b-50a9a9afac28\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest\n\n\n\n\nPOST /oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/token HTTP/1.1\nHost: seed.gluu.org\nAuthorization: Basic QCExMTExITAwMDghRkY4MSEyRDM5OjYyMTNlOWI5LWM0NmQtNDAwOC04YWYxLTAzZjkxOGE4YWRlNA==\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\ngrant_type=password&scope=openid&username=mike&password=secret\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\n\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store, private\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{\"access_token\":\"26d55e4b-6c61-40ea-9763-3282f5db0f0e\",\"token_type\":\"bearer\",\"expires_in\":3599,\"refresh_token\":\"aba91bd9-aa10-4fca-952b-50a9a9afac28\",\"scope\":\"openid\",\"id_token\":\"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvc2VlZC5nbHV1Lm9yZyIsInVzZXJfaWQiOiJtaWtlIiwiYXVkIjoiQCExMTExITAwMDghRkY4MSEyRDM5IiwiZXhwIjoxMzM5MTk2ODgxMzAzLCJveEludW0iOiJAITExMTEhMDAwMCFENEU3Iiwib3hWYWxpZGF0aW9uVVJJIjoiaHR0cHM6XC9cL3NlZWQuZ2x1dS5vcmdcL294YXV0aFwvc2VhbVwvcmVzb3VyY2VcL3Jlc3R2MVwvb3hhdXRoXC9jaGVja19zZXNzaW9uIiwib3hPcGVuSURDb25uZWN0VmVyc2lvbiI6Im9wZW5pZGNvbm5lY3QtMS4wIn0.SzWfJsmlz62qTRw1lEJZ8PygY9eRupgmsbXLCQwPVDQ\"}\n\n\n\n\nGluu OAuth2 Access Management\n#\n\n\n[GAT][Gluu Access Token] is used for Gluu OAuth2 Access Management.\n\n\nOverview\n#\n\n\n\nCentralized Access Management needs a profile enabling a client ot obtain a token from the AS by explicitly specifyting the \nrequested scopes.\n\n\nGluu Access Token\n#\n\n\nGAT as plain json\n#\n\n\n{\n    \"exp\": 1256953732,\n    \"iat\": 1256912345,\n    \"scopes\" : {\n       \"view\", \"manage\"\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe [GAT][Gluu Access Token] is issued at a new endpoint which is published at \n<hostname>/.well-known/uma-configuration\n\n\nImportant:\n all requests/response to/from/between RP, RS, AS must contain \"GAT\" HTTP header with \"true\" value.

            "text": "Overview\n#\n\n\nOpenID Connect is an authentication layer built on OAuth 2.0. \nOpenID Connect is a specific implementation of OAuth 2.0 \nwhere the identity provider holds protected resources that a \nthird-party application needs to access on behalf of a person. \nOpenID Connect allows relying parties to verify the identity of, and obtain information about a person requesting to access the applications protected resources. \n\n\nJargon\n#\n\n\nIn OpenID Connect the key entities include:\n\n\n\n\nThe \nend user\n (a.k.a. OAuth 2.0 resource owner) whose user information the application needs to access.\n\n\n\n\nThe end user wants to login to an application using an existing account at an OpenID Connect identity provider (OP).\n\n\n\n\nThe \nRelying Party (RP)\n (a.k.a. OAuth 2.0 client) needs access to the end user's protected user information.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, an online chat application needs to know who is accessing the application in order to present the correct user account and contacts. \n\n\n\n\nThe \nOpenID Provider (OP)\n (a.k.a. OAuth 2.0 authorization server and also resource server) that holds the user information and grants access.\n\n\n\n\nThe Gluu Server is an OpenID Provider. The OP holds information about the user and allows the end user or the organization (depending on configuration) to consent to providing the RP with access to user information. OpenID Connect defines a unique identification for an account (subject identifier + issuer identifier), and the RP can use this as a key to its own user profile. \n\n\nThe relying party can verify claims about the identity of the end user, and log the user out at the end of a session. OpenID Connect also makes it possible to discover the OpenID Provider for an end user, and to register relying party client applications dynamically. OpenID connect services are built on OAuth 2.0, JSON Web Token (JWT), WebFinger and Well-Known URIs.\n\n\nOpenID Connect Support in the Gluu Server\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server is a \nfully certified OpenID Connect Provider (OP)\n. As an OpenID Provider, the Gluu Server enables OpenID Connect relying parties (clients) to discover its capabilities, handle both dynamic and static registration of relying parties, respond to relying party requests with authorization codes, access tokens, and user information according to the Authorization Code and Implicit flows of OpenID Connect, and manages sessions.\n\n\nOpenID Connect Implicit Flow\n#\n\n\nThe OpenID Connect Implicit Flow specifies how the relying party interacts with the OpenID Provider based on use of the OAuth 2.0 implicit grant. The main difference between the OAuth and OpenID Connect implicit flows lie in the use of the id_token, which must be returned in Connect. The id_token adds additional security to the transaction. For more information, read the \nOpenID Connect Implicit Client Implementer's guide\n.\n\n\nOpenID Connect Authorization Code Flow\n#\n\n\nThe OpenID Connect Authorization Code Flow specifies how the relying party interacts with the OpenID Provider based on use of the OAuth 2.0 authorization grant. The authorization code flow is more secure than the implicit flow because the tokens are never exposed to the web browser and possibly other malicious applications with access to the browser. As with the implicit flow the extra securuty in Connect's authorization code flow stems from the id_token. \n\n\nOpenID Connect Hybrid Flow\n#\n\n\nDiscovery\n#\n\n\nThe first thing you want to know about any OAuth 2.0 API is where the\nendpoints are (i.e. what are the URIs where you call the APIs).\nOpenID Connect provides a very simple mechanism to accomplish this: \n\nOpenID Connect Discovery\n.\n\n\nIn order for an OpenID Connect Relying Party to utilize OpenID Connect\nservices for an End-User, the RP needs to know where the OpenID Provider is.\nOpenID Connect uses \nWebFinger\n\nto locate the OpenID Provider for an End-User.\n\n\nOnce the OpenID Provider has been identified, the configuration information\nfor the OP is retrieved from a well-known location as a JSON document,\nincluding its OAuth 2.0 endpoint locations.\n\n\nSample Discovery Request\n#\n\n\nIf you want to try a discovery request, you can make the following\nWebFinger request to discover the Issuer location:\n\n\nGET /.well-known/webfinger?resource=https%3A%2F%2Fidp.gluu.org&rel=http%3A%2F%2Fopenid.net%2Fspecs%2Fconnect%2F1.0%2Fissuer HTTP/1.1\nHost: idp.gluu.org\n\nHTTP/1.1 200\nContent-Type: application/jrd+json\n\n{\n    \"subject\": \"https://idp.gluu.org\",\n    \"links\": [{\n        \"rel\": \"http://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer\",\n        \"href\": \"https://idp.gluu.org\"\n    }]\n}\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Issuer location discovered, the OpenID Provider's configuration information can be retrieved.\n\n\nThe RP makes the following request to the Issuer \nhttps://<domain>/.well-known/openid-configuration\n to obtain its\nConfiguration information:\n\n\nGET /.well-known/openid-configuration HTTP/1.1\nHost: idp.gluu.org\n\nHTTP/1.1

The specification has the relying party monitor session state using an invisible iframe and communicate status using the HTML 5 postMessage API.\n\n\nHowever, be forewarned that there is no perfect answer to logout that\nsatisfies all requirements for all domains on the Internet. For\nexample, large OpenID Providers, like Google, need a totally stateless\nimplementation--Google cannot track sessions on the server side for\nevery browser on the Internet. But in smaller domains, server side\nlogout functionality can be a convenient solution to cleaning up\nresources.\n\n\nThe OpenID Connect \nSession\nManagement\n is\nstill marked as draft, and new mechanisms for logout are in the works.\nThe current specification requires JavaScript to detect that the session\nhas been ended in the browser. It works... unless the tab with the\nJavaScript happens to be closed when the logout event happens on another\ntab. Also, inserting JavaScript into every page is not feasible for some\napplications. A new proposal is under discussion where the OpenID\nConnect logout API would return \nIMG\n HTML tags to the browser with the\nlogout callbacks of the clients. This way, the browser could call the\nlogout uris (not the server).\n\n\nThe Gluu Server is very flexible, and supports both server side session\nmanagement, and stateless session management. For server side\nlogout, the domain admin can use \nCustom Logout scripts\n. This can be\nuseful to clean up sessions in a legacy SSO system (i.e. SiteMinder), or\nperhaps in a portal.\n\n\nThe key for logout is to understand the limitations of logout, and to\ntest the use cases that are important to you, so you will not be\nsurprised by the behavior when you put your application into production.\n\n\nOpenID Connect Relying Party Registration\n#\n\n\nRelying parties can register with the Gluu Server both statically, by the Gluu Server admin, and dynamically, as specified by OpenID Connect Discovery. To allow dynamic registration, you register an initial OAuth 2.0 client that other relying parties can use to get access tokens for registration. You can also enable OpenID Connect relying parties to register dynamically without having to provide an access token. If dynamic registration is enabled, make sure to limit or throttle registrations as it could be used as a form of DDOS.\n\n\nClient Code\n#\n\n\nAlthough you can use generic OAuth 2.0 client libraries to call OpenID Connect endpoints, you would have to implement code to take advantage of some of OpenID Connect's features. For example, there is no id_token in OAuth 2.0, so you won't find any code for id_token validation in an OAuth 2.0 library. A good OpenID Connect client will do much of the heavy lifting for you. \n\n\nJavaScript Client\n#\n\n\nA JavaScript client is one of the easiest ways to use OpenID Connect, although it's not the most secure. The client we recommend was forked from a sample application written to demonstrate how easy it is to use Connect. Gluu forked the code, and has enhanced it since the time of its original publishing. The project can be found on \nGithub\n.\n\n\nIt's not a fancy app--it sends the person to the authorization endpoint to be authenticated, and then prints the claims tha are returned in the id_token. Currently the client does not handle dynamic client registration. \n\n\nYou'll have to add the client manually to the Gluu Server via the GUI. When completing the \nadd client\n form, you can use the following configuration:\n\n\nClient Name: Implicit Test Client\nresponse_type: token id_token\nApplication Type: Web\nPre-Authorization: Enabled\nSubject Type: public\nScopes: openid, profile, email\nResponse Types: token id_token\nGrant Types: implicit\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have registered the client in the Gluu Server, all you need to do is update the \nclient_id\n, \nredirect_uri\n, and \nproviderInfo\n values in the login page html. Assuming you've checked out the project into a web accessible folder, then navigate to the page and test! \n\n\nServer-Side libraries\n#\n\n\nMany applications are \"server-side\", meaning the web page displays content but most of the dynamic business logic resides on the web server. The OpenID Foundation maintains a list of client libraries on \ntheir website\n. However, our experience has been that the quality of these libraries varies widely. Some are not well documented, other are not updated frequently, and some do not implement essential security features available in OpenID Connect. In addition, if a wide array of client libraries are used it becomes difficult to monitor and patch security vulnerabilities. For this reason, we recommend that you use our OpenID Connect middleware software called \noxd\n.  \n\n\noxd is not open source, but it is very reasonably priced at $0.33 per day per server--or ~$10/month. The code is available on \nGitHub\n, and there are free open source oxd libraries available for PHP, Java, Python, C#, Node, Ruby, Perl and Go. There are also plugins available for several popular open source applications.\n\n\nWatch the oxd demo\n.\n\n\nGet an oxd license for free\n\n\nApache HTTPD module\n#\n\n\nA popular approach to protecting web applications is to use a web server filter to intercept the request, and make sure the person using that connection is authenticated and authorized. The web server with the filter may directly serve the application, or may proxy to a backend service. Leveraging the web server is a well established pattern, used by older access management platforms like CA Siteminder and Oracle Access Manager. \n\n\nOne of the advantages of the web server filter approach is that the application developer does not need to know that much about the security protocols--if the request makes it through to the application, the person has been authenticated and the request is authorized. Another advantage is that the application security is administered by the system administrators, not by developers. For example, it may be easier to manage and audit apache configuration than to read a bunch of code. \n\n\nOne of the best OpenID Connect relying party implementations was written by Hans Zandbelt, called \nmod_auth_openidc\n. It is an authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that authenticates users against an OpenID Connect Provider (OP). The software can be found on GitHub and is included in the package management system for several Linux distributions. There are binary packages available, and if you are good at compiling C code, you can build it yourself from the source. \n\n\nNote: if you are an Nginx fan, there is a similar \nLua implementation\n to make NGINX operate as an OpenID Connect RP or OAuth 2.0 RS. \n\n\nAppAuth for Mobile Applications\n#\n\n\nOne of the most compelling reasons to use Connect is to authenticate people from a mobile application. The IETF draft \n\"OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps\"\n provides an overview of an improved design for mobile security. In additio to the security features of OpenID Connect, this draft suggests the use of a PKCE and custom URI schemes (i.e. an application can register a URI such as myapp:// instead of https://).\n\n\nIn 2016, Google released and then donated code to the OpenID Foundation called AppAuth for \nAndroid\n and \niOS\n. The AppAuth projects also include sample applications. Simulataneously, Google announced that it was deprecating the use of WebViews--a strategy used by mobile app developers which is vulnerable to malicious application code. Not only does AppAuth provide secure authentication, it enables SSO across the system browser and mobile applications. It accomplishes this by leveraging new operating system features that enable the system browser to be called by an application in an opaque view that does not enable an app developer to steal a person's credentials, or other applications to steal codes or tokens. Using this approach, mobile app developers can use the authorization code or hypbrid flow (as described earlier). \n\n\nThe Gluu Server is the only free open source OpenID Connect Provider that currently supports AppAuth. \n\n\noxAuth RP\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server ships with an optional OpenID Connect relying party web application, which is handy for testing.  It's called oxauth-rp. During Gluu Server setup, you'll be asked if you want to install it--which you should on a development environment. It will be deployed on \nhttps://<hostname>/oxauth-rp\n. Using this tool you can exercise all of the OpenID Connect API's, including discovery, client registration, authorization, token, userinfo, and end_session.",

The specification has the relying party monitor session state using an invisible iframe and communicate status using the HTML 5 postMessage API.  However, be forewarned that there is no perfect answer to logout that\nsatisfies all requirements for all domains on the Internet. For\nexample, large OpenID Providers, like Google, need a totally stateless\nimplementation--Google cannot track sessions on the server side for\nevery browser on the Internet. But in smaller domains, server side\nlogout functionality can be a convenient solution to cleaning up\nresources.  The OpenID Connect  Session\nManagement  is\nstill marked as draft, and new mechanisms for logout are in the works.\nThe current specification requires JavaScript to detect that the session\nhas been ended in the browser. It works... unless the tab with the\nJavaScript happens to be closed when the logout event happens on another\ntab. Also, inserting JavaScript into every page is not feasible for some\napplications. A new proposal is under discussion where the OpenID\nConnect logout API would return  IMG  HTML tags to the browser with the\nlogout callbacks of the clients. This way, the browser could call the\nlogout uris (not the server).  The Gluu Server is very flexible, and supports both server side session\nmanagement, and stateless session management. For server side\nlogout, the domain admin can use  Custom Logout scripts . This can be\nuseful to clean up sessions in a legacy SSO system (i.e. SiteMinder), or\nperhaps in a portal.  The key for logout is to understand the limitations of logout, and to\ntest the use cases that are important to you, so you will not be\nsurprised by the behavior when you put your application into production.",

In addition, if a wide array of client libraries are used it becomes difficult to monitor and patch security vulnerabilities. For this reason, we recommend that you use our OpenID Connect middleware software called  oxd .    oxd is not open source, but it is very reasonably priced at $0.33 per day per server--or ~$10/month. The code is available on  GitHub , and there are free open source oxd libraries available for PHP, Java, Python, C#, Node, Ruby, Perl and Go.

The web server with the filter may directly serve the application, or may proxy to a backend service. Leveraging the web server is a well established pattern, used by older access management platforms like CA Siteminder and Oracle Access Manager.   One of the advantages of the web server filter approach is that the application developer does not need to know that much about the security protocols--if the request makes it through to the application, the person has been authenticated and the request is authorized. Another advantage is that the application security is administered by the system administrators, not by developers. For example, it may be easier to manage and audit apache configuration than to read a bunch of code.   One of the best OpenID Connect relying party implementations was written by Hans Zandbelt, called  mod_auth_openidc . It is an authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that authenticates users against an OpenID Connect Provider (OP). The software can be found on GitHub and is included in the package management system for several Linux distributions. There are binary packages available, and if you are good at compiling C code, you can build it yourself from the source.   Note: if you are an Nginx fan, there is a similar  Lua implementation  to make NGINX operate as an OpenID Connect RP or OAuth 2.0 RS.",

The IETF draft  \"OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps\"  provides an overview of an improved design for mobile security. In additio to the security features of OpenID Connect, this draft suggests the use of a PKCE and custom URI schemes (i.e. an application can register a URI such as myapp:// instead of https://).  In 2016, Google released and then donated code to the OpenID Foundation called AppAuth for  Android  and  iOS . The AppAuth projects also include sample applications. Simulataneously, Google announced that it was deprecating the use of WebViews--a strategy used by mobile app developers which is vulnerable to malicious application code. Not only does AppAuth provide secure authentication, it enables SSO across the system browser and mobile applications. It accomplishes this by leveraging new operating system features that enable the system browser to be called by an application in an opaque view that does not enable an app developer to steal a person's credentials, or other applications to steal codes or tokens. Using this approach, mobile app developers can use the authorization code or hypbrid flow (as described earlier).

There are lots of articles around the Web on how to do this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupply the UMA parameters and run the code. \nNOTE:\n If you have re-installed Gluu CE, please note that the UMA parameters / JWKS files are also regenerated.

Instead of UMA + SCIM-Client, in test mode a long-lived OAuth2 access token issued by the Gluu server is used to authorize with the SCIM 2.0 endpoints.\n\n\nTo enable test mode, do the following:\n\n\n\n\nLogin to the oxTrust GUI and go to \"Configuration\" -> \"JSON Configuration\" -> \"OxTrust Configuration\", then locate the property \nscimTestMode\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet it to \ntrue\n, then click the \"Save Configuration\" button. The Gluu server will then create a long-lived OAuth2 access token with a validity period of one year. Doing this will also switch the authentication scheme from UMA to OAuth2 Access Token.\n\n\nClick again \"JSON Configuration\" -> \"OxTrust Configuration\" in the left navigation pane. This will retrieve the access token and be displayed in the \nscimTestModeAccessToken\n property.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the access token has expired, just repeat the previous steps to create a new one.\n\n\n\n\nThe access token can then be used as the query string parameter \naccess_token\n in accessing the SCIM 2.0 endpoints, for example:\n\n\n\n\nYou can verify the current authentication scheme of the SCIM 2.0 endpoints by browsing its \nServiceProviderConfig\n:\n\n\n\n\nTo exit test mode, just set \nscimTestMode\n back to \nfalse\n then click the \"Save Configuration\" button. This will switch the authentication scheme from OAuth2 Access Token to UMA. If you try using your access token again, you will now get the \n403 Unauthorized\n error:\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n#\n\n\nUMA is protected with SCIM in Gluu Server Community Edition (CE). The usage of UMA requires HTTP GET and HTTP POST requests. Before testing, the Client making the requests must be added/registered in Gluu CE. The UMA configuration is available @ \nhttps://hostname/.well-known/uma-configuration\n. The request to authorization endpoint must accompanied with  application/json content type. \n\n\nThe example below shows the parameters used in a real-life use case  where the UMA RPT Token is authorized in oxAuth.\n\n\n    public RptAuthorizationResponse requestRptPermissionAuthorization(@HeaderParam(\"Authorization\") String authorization,\n            @HeaderParam(\"Host\") String amHost, RptAuthorizationRequest rptAuthorizationRequest);\n\n\n\n\nIf the default openID SCIM Client is not used, the \ninum\n must be added to the UMA Authorization Policy Custom Script.",

Instead of UMA + SCIM-Client, in test mode a long-lived OAuth2 access token issued by the Gluu server is used to authorize with the SCIM 2.0 endpoints.  To enable test mode, do the following:   Login to the oxTrust GUI and go to \"Configuration\" -> \"JSON Configuration\" -> \"OxTrust Configuration\", then locate the property  scimTestMode .     Set it to  true , then click the \"Save Configuration\" button. The Gluu server will then create a long-lived OAuth2 access token with a validity period of one year. Doing this will also switch the authentication scheme from UMA to OAuth2 Access Token.  Click again \"JSON Configuration\" -> \"OxTrust Configuration\" in the left navigation pane. This will retrieve the access token and be displayed in the  scimTestModeAccessToken  property.     If the access token has expired, just repeat the previous steps to create a new one.   The access token can then be used as the query string parameter  access_token  in accessing the SCIM 2.0 endpoints, for example:   You can verify the current authentication scheme of the SCIM 2.0 endpoints by browsing its  ServiceProviderConfig :   To exit test mode, just set  scimTestMode  back to  false  then click the \"Save Configuration\" button. This will switch the authentication scheme from OAuth2 Access Token to UMA. If you try using your access token again, you will now get the  403 Unauthorized  error:",

If omitted, the default is that the Client will use only the code Response Type. Allowed values are code, token, id_token\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngrant_types\n\n\nA list of the OAuth 2.0 Grant Types that the Client is declaring that it will restrict itself to using. The Grant Type values used by OpenID Connect are:\nauthorization_code\nThe Authorization Code Grant Type\nimplicit\nThe Implicit Grant Type\nrefresh_token\nThe Refresh Token Grant Type\nThe following table lists the correspondence between response_type values that the Client will use and grant_type values that MUST be included in the registered grant_types list:\ncode: authorization_code\nid_token: implicit\ntoken id_token: implicit\ncode id_token: authorization_code, implicit\ncode token: authorization_code, implicit\ncode token id_token: authorization_code, implicit\n\n\n\n\n\n\napplication_type\n\n\nKind of the application. The default, if omitted, is web. The defined values are native or web. Web Clients using the OAuth Implicit Grant Type must only register URLs using the https scheme as redirect_uris; they must not use localhost as the hostname. Native Clients must only register redirect_uris using custom URI schemes or URLs using the http: scheme with localhost as the hostname.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontacts\n\n\ne-mail addresses of people responsible for this Client.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclient_name\n\n\nName of the Client to be presented to the End-User.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlogo_uri\n\n\nURL that references a logo for the Client application. If present, the server displays this image to the End-User during approval. The value of this field must point to a valid image file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclient_uri\n\n\nURL of the home page of the Client. The value of this field must point to a valid Web page. If present, the server displays this URL to the End-User in a followable fashion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npolicy_uri\n\n\nURL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-User to read about the how the profile data will be used. The value of this field must point to a valid web page. The OpenID Provider displays this URL to the End-User if it is given.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntos_uri\n\n\nURL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-User to read about the Relying Party's terms of service. The value of this field must point to a valid web page. The OpenID Provider displays this URL to the End-User if it is given.\n\n\n\n\n\n\njwks_uri\n\n\nURL for the Client's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document. If the Client signs requests to the Server, it contains the signing key(s) the Server uses to validate signatures from the Client. The JWK Set may also contain the Client's encryption keys(s), which are used by the Server to encrypt responses to the Client. When both signing and encryption keys are made available, a use (Key Use) parameter value is required for all keys in the referenced JWK Set to indicate each key's intended usage. Although some algorithms allow the same key to be used for both signatures and encryption, doing so is not recommended, as it is less secure. The JWK x5c parameter MAY be used to provide X.509 representations of keys provided. When used, the bare key values must still be present and must match those in the certificate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\njwks\n\n\nClient's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document, passed by value. The semantics of the jwks parameter are the same as the jwks_uri parameter, other than that the JWK Set is passed by value, rather than by reference. This parameter is intended only to be used by Clients that, for some reason, are unable to use the jwks_uri parameter, for instance, by native applications that might not have a location to host the contents of the JWK Set. If a Client can use jwks_uri, it must not use jwks. One significant downside of jwks is that it does not enable key rotation (which jwks_uri does). The jwks_uri and jwks parameters must not be used together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsector_identifier_uri\n\n\nURL using the https scheme to be used in calculating Pseudonymous Identifiers by the OP. The URL references a file with a single JSON array of redirect_uri values. Providers that use pairwise sub (subject) values utilizes the sector_identifier_uri value provided in the Subject Identifier calculation for pairwise identifiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubject_type\n\n\nsubject_type requested for responses to this Client. The subject_types_supported Discovery parameter contains a list of the supported subject_type values for this server. Valid types include pairwise and public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid_token_signed_response_alg\n\n\nJWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing the ID Token issued to this Client. The value none must not be used as the ID Token alg value unless the Client uses only Response Types that return no ID Token from the Authorization Endpoint (such as when only using the Authorization Code Flow). The default, if omitted, is RS256. The public key for validating the signature is provided by retrieving the JWK Set referenced by the jwks_uri element from OpenID Connect Discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid_token_encrypted_response_alg\n\n\nJWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If this is requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid_token_encrypted_response_enc\n\n\nJWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If id_token_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When id_token_encrypted_response_enc is included, id_token_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuserinfo_signed_response_alg\n\n\nJWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing UserInfo Responses. If this is specified, the response will be JWT serialized, and signed using JWS. The default, if omitted, is for the UserInfo Response to return the Claims as a UTF-8 encoded JSON object using the application/json content-type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuserinfo_encrypted_response_alg\n\n\nJWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If both signing and encryption are requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuserinfo_encrypted_response_enc\n\n\nJWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If userinfo_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When userinfo_encrypted_response_enc is included, userinfo_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_object_signing_alg\n\n\nJWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing Request Objects sent to the OP. All Request Objects from this Client are rejected, if not signed with this algorithm. This algorithm is used both when the Request Object is passed by value (using the request parameter) and when it is passed by reference (using the request_uri parameter). The value none may be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP may be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_object_encryption_alg\n\n\nJWE alg algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. This parameter should be included when symmetric encryption will be used, since this signals to the OP that a client_secret value needs to be returned from which the symmetric key will be derived, that might not otherwise be returned. The RP may still use other supported encryption algorithms or send unencrypted Request Objects, even when this parameter is present. If both signing and encryption are requested, the Request Object will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that the RP is not declaring whether it might encrypt any Request Objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_object_encryption_enc\n\n\nJWE enc algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. If request_object_encryption_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When request_object_encryption_enc is included, request_object_encryption_alg must also be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntoken_endpoint_auth_method\n\n\nRequested Client Authentication method for the Token Endpoint. The options are client_secret_post, client_secret_basic, client_secret_jwt, private_key_jwt, and none. If omitted, the default is client_secret_basic, the HTTP Basic Authentication Scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntoken_endpoint_auth_signing_alg\n\n\nJWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing the JWT used to authenticate the Client at the Token Endpoint for the private_key_jwt and client_secret_jwt authentication methods. All Token Requests using these authentication methods from this Client are rejected, if the JWT is not signed with this algorithm. The value none must not be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP MAY be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndefault_max_age\n\n\nDefault Maximum Authentication Age. Specifies that the End-User must be actively authenticated if the End-User was authenticated longer ago than the specified number of seconds. The max_age request parameter overrides this default value. If omitted, no default Maximum Authentication Age is specified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequire_auth_time\n\n\nBoolean value specifying whether the auth_time Claim in the ID Token is required. It is required when the value is true. (If this is false, the auth_time Claim can still be dynamically requested as an individual Claim for the ID Token using the claims request parameter) If omitted, the default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndefault_acr_values\n\n\nDefault requested Authentication Context Class Reference values. Array of strings that specifies the default acr values that the OP is being requested to use for processing requests from this Client, with the values appearing in order of preference. The Authentication Context Class satisfied by the authentication performed is returned as the acr Claim Value in the issued ID Token. The acr Claim is requested as a Voluntary Claim by this parameter. The acr_values_supported discovery element contains a list of the supported acr values supported by this server. Values specified in the acr_values request parameter or an individual acr Claim request override these default values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitiate_login_uri\n\n\nURI using the https scheme that a third party can use to initiate a login by the RP. The URI must accept requests via both GET and POST. The Client must understand the login_hint and iss parameters and should support the target_link_uri parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_uris\n\n\nrequest_uri values that are pre-registered by the RP for use at the OP. The Servers cache the contents of the files referenced by these URIs and not retrieve them at the time they are used in a request. OPs can require that request_uri values used be pre-registered with the require_request_uri_registration discovery parameter. If the contents of the request file could ever change, these URI values should include the base64url encoded SHA-256 hash value of the file contents referenced by the URI as the value of the URI fragment. If the fragment value used for a URI changes, that signals the server that its cached value for that URI with the old fragment value is no longer valid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n#\n\n\nClient Identificator or INUM, a client shared secret and the account expiration date in a [JSON[Response]]\n\n\nErrors\n#\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \nStatus Code|\nReason|\n    \n\n    \n\n            \n400|invalid_request\nThe request is missing a required parameter, includes an unsupported parameter or parameter value, repeats the same parameter, uses more than one method for including an access token, or is otherwise malformed.

possession of a permission ticket and an AAT for this\nauthorization server, the client asks the authorization server to give\nit authorization data corresponding to that permission ticket. It\nperforms a POST on the RPT endpoint, supplying its own AAT in the header\nand a JSON object in the body with a \"ticket\" property containing the\nticket as its value.\n\n\nIf the client had included an RPT in its failed access attempt, It MAY\nalso provide that RPT in an \"rpt\" property in its request to the\nauthorization server.\n\n\nIn circumstances where the client needs to provide requesting party\nclaims to the authorization server, it MAY also include a \"claim_tokens\"\nproperty in its request; see Section 3.4.1.2.1 for more information. The\nauthorization server uses the ticket to look up the details of the\npreviously registered requested permission, maps the requested\npermission to operative resource owner policies based on the resource\nset identifier and scopes associated with it, potentially requests\nadditional information, and ultimately responds positively or negatively\nto the request for authorization data.\n\n\nThe authorization server bases the issuing of authorization data on\nresource owner policies. These policies thus amount to an asynchronous\nOAuth authorization grant. The authorization server is also free to\nenable the resource owner to set policies that require the owner to\ninteract with the server in near-real time to provide consent subsequent\nto an access attempt. All such processes are outside the scope of this\nspecification.\n\n\nURL\n\n    http://gluu.org/requester/perm\n\n\nParameters\n\n- body\n\n\n|Parameter|Required|Description|Data Type|\n|body|false||\nRptAuthorizationRequest\n|\n- header\n\n\n|Parameter|Required|Description|Data Type|\n|Authorization|false||string|\n|Host|false||string|\n\n\nResponse\n\n\n\n\nErrors\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \nStatus Code|\nReason|\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n403|Forbidden.

This URI MUST exactly match one of the  Redirection URI values for the Client pre-registered at the OpenID Provider  string    state  false  Opaque value used to maintain state between the request and the callback.  Typically, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF, XSRF) mitigation is done by cryptographically binding  the value of this parameter with a browser cookie.  string    response_mode  false  This parameter informs the authorization server about the mechanism to be used to return  parameters from the authorization endpoint. This is not recommended if the default for  response_type is requested.  string    nonce  false  String value used to associate a Client session with an ID Token, and to mitigate replay attacks.  The value is passed through unmodified from the Authorization Request to the ID Token.  Sufficient entropy MUST be present in the nonce values used to prevent attackers from guessing  values.  string    display  false  ASCII string value that specifies how the Authorization Server displays the authentication  and consent user  interface pages to the end-user. The defined values are: page, popup, touch, wap  string    prompt  false  Space delimited, case sensitive list of ASCII string values that specifies whether the  Authorization Server prompts the end-user for re-authentication and consent.  The defined values are: none, login, consent, select_account  string    max_age  false  Maximum Authentication Age. Specifies the allowable elapsed time in seconds since the last  time the end-user was actively authenticated by the OP. If the elapsed  time is greater than this value, the OP MUST attempt to actively re-authenticate the end-user.  (The max_age request parameter corresponds to the OpenID 2.0 PAPE [OpenID.PAPE]  max_auth_age request parameter.) When max_age is used, the ID Token returned MUST include an  auth_time Claim Value.  int    ui_locales  false  end-user's preferred languages and scripts for the user interface, represented as a space-separated  list of BCP47 [RFC5646] language tag values, ordered by preference. For instance, the value \"fr-CA fr en\" represents a preference for French as spoken  in Canada, then French (without a region designation), followed by English (without a region designation). An error SHOULD NOT result if some or all of the requested  locales are not supported by the OpenID Provider.  string    id_token_hint  false  ID Token previously issued by the Authorization Server being passed as a hint about the end-user's  current or past authenticated session with the Client. If the end-user identified by the ID Token is logged in or is logged in by the request, then the Authorization  Server returns a positive response; otherwise, it SHOULD return an error, such as login_required. When possible, an id_token_hint SHOULD be present when prompt=none  is used and an invalid_request error MAY be returned if it is not; however, the server SHOULD respond successfully when possible, even if it is not present.  The Authorization Server need not be listed as an audience of the ID Token when it is used as an id_token_hint value.  string    login_hint  false  Hint to the Authorization Server about the login identifier the end-user might use to log in (if necessary).  This hint can be used by an RP if it first asks the end-user for their e-mail address (or other identifier) and then wants to pass that value as a hint to the discovered  authorization service. It is RECOMMENDED that the hint value match the value used for discovery. This value MAY also be a phone number in the format specified for the  phone_number Claim. The use of this parameter is left to the OP's discretion.  string    acr_values  false  Requested Authentication Context Class Reference values. Space-separated string that specifies the acr values that the  Authorization Server is being requested to use for processing this Authentication Request, with the values appearing in order of preference. The  Authentication Context Class satisfied by the authentication performed is returned as the acr Claim Value, as specified in Section 2. The acr Claim is requested as a  Voluntary Claim by this parameter.  string    amr_values  false  AMR Values  string    request  false  This parameter enables OpenID Connect requests to be passed in a single, self-contained parameter and to be optionally  signed and/or encrypted. The parameter value is a Request Object value, as specified in Section 6.1. It represents the request as a JWT whose Claims are the  request parameters.  string    request_uri  false  This parameter enables OpenID Connect requests to be passed by reference, rather than by value. The request_uri  value is a URL using the https scheme referencing a resource containing a Request Object value, which is a JWT containing the request parameters.  string    request_session_state  false  Request session state  string    sessionState  false  This is an optional parameter  string    accessToken  false  This parameter is optinal and carries the access token for the request.  string    origin_headers  false  This optional token is used in custom workflows.  string    codeChallange  false  This parameter allows the code to be challanced using PKCE.  string    codeChallangeMethod  false  This parameter allows the use of PKCE to challange code.  string    httpRequest  false  This is an optional parameter  string    securityContext  false  This is an injectable interface that provides access to security related information.  string      query   \n         \n             Parameter|Required|Description|Data Type|\n|response_mode|false|Informs the Authorization Server of the mechanism to be used for returning parameters from the Authorization Endpoint.

The Grant Type values used by OpenID Connect are: authorization_code The Authorization Code Grant Type implicit The Implicit Grant Type refresh_token The Refresh Token Grant Type The following table lists the correspondence between response_type values that the Client will use and grant_type values that MUST be included in the registered grant_types list: code: authorization_code id_token: implicit token id_token: implicit code id_token: authorization_code, implicit code token: authorization_code, implicit code token id_token: authorization_code, implicit    application_type  Kind of the application. The default, if omitted, is web. The defined values are native or web. Web Clients using the OAuth Implicit Grant Type must only register URLs using the https scheme as redirect_uris; they must not use localhost as the hostname. Native Clients must only register redirect_uris using custom URI schemes or URLs using the http: scheme with localhost as the hostname.    contacts  e-mail addresses of people responsible for this Client.    client_name  Name of the Client to be presented to the End-User.    logo_uri  URL that references a logo for the Client application. If present, the server displays this image to the End-User during approval. The value of this field must point to a valid image file.    client_uri  URL of the home page of the Client. The value of this field must point to a valid Web page. If present, the server displays this URL to the End-User in a followable fashion.    policy_uri  URL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-User to read about the how the profile data will be used. The value of this field must point to a valid web page. The OpenID Provider displays this URL to the End-User if it is given.    tos_uri  URL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-User to read about the Relying Party's terms of service. The value of this field must point to a valid web page. The OpenID Provider displays this URL to the End-User if it is given.    jwks_uri  URL for the Client's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document. If the Client signs requests to the Server, it contains the signing key(s) the Server uses to validate signatures from the Client. The JWK Set may also contain the Client's encryption keys(s), which are used by the Server to encrypt responses to the Client. When both signing and encryption keys are made available, a use (Key Use) parameter value is required for all keys in the referenced JWK Set to indicate each key's intended usage. Although some algorithms allow the same key to be used for both signatures and encryption, doing so is not recommended, as it is less secure. The JWK x5c parameter MAY be used to provide X.509 representations of keys provided. When used, the bare key values must still be present and must match those in the certificate.    jwks  Client's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document, passed by value. The semantics of the jwks parameter are the same as the jwks_uri parameter, other than that the JWK Set is passed by value, rather than by reference. This parameter is intended only to be used by Clients that, for some reason, are unable to use the jwks_uri parameter, for instance, by native applications that might not have a location to host the contents of the JWK Set. If a Client can use jwks_uri, it must not use jwks. One significant downside of jwks is that it does not enable key rotation (which jwks_uri does). The jwks_uri and jwks parameters must not be used together.    sector_identifier_uri  URL using the https scheme to be used in calculating Pseudonymous Identifiers by the OP. The URL references a file with a single JSON array of redirect_uri values. Providers that use pairwise sub (subject) values utilizes the sector_identifier_uri value provided in the Subject Identifier calculation for pairwise identifiers.    subject_type  subject_type requested for responses to this Client. The subject_types_supported Discovery parameter contains a list of the supported subject_type values for this server. Valid types include pairwise and public.    id_token_signed_response_alg  JWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing the ID Token issued to this Client. The value none must not be used as the ID Token alg value unless the Client uses only Response Types that return no ID Token from the Authorization Endpoint (such as when only using the Authorization Code Flow). The default, if omitted, is RS256. The public key for validating the signature is provided by retrieving the JWK Set referenced by the jwks_uri element from OpenID Connect Discovery.    id_token_encrypted_response_alg  JWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If this is requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.    id_token_encrypted_response_enc  JWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If id_token_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When id_token_encrypted_response_enc is included, id_token_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.    userinfo_signed_response_alg  JWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing UserInfo Responses. If this is specified, the response will be JWT serialized, and signed using JWS. The default, if omitted, is for the UserInfo Response to return the Claims as a UTF-8 encoded JSON object using the application/json content-type.    userinfo_encrypted_response_alg  JWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If both signing and encryption are requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.    userinfo_encrypted_response_enc  JWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If userinfo_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When userinfo_encrypted_response_enc is included, userinfo_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.    request_object_signing_alg  JWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing Request Objects sent to the OP. All Request Objects from this Client are rejected, if not signed with this algorithm. This algorithm is used both when the Request Object is passed by value (using the request parameter) and when it is passed by reference (using the request_uri parameter). The value none may be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP may be used.    request_object_encryption_alg  JWE alg algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. This parameter should be included when symmetric encryption will be used, since this signals to the OP that a client_secret value needs to be returned from which the symmetric key will be derived, that might not otherwise be returned. The RP may still use other supported encryption algorithms or send unencrypted Request Objects, even when this parameter is present. If both signing and encryption are requested, the Request Object will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that the RP is not declaring whether it might encrypt any Request Objects.    request_object_encryption_enc  JWE enc algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. If request_object_encryption_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When request_object_encryption_enc is included, request_object_encryption_alg must also be provided.    token_endpoint_auth_method  Requested Client Authentication method for the Token Endpoint. The options are client_secret_post, client_secret_basic, client_secret_jwt, private_key_jwt, and none. If omitted, the default is client_secret_basic, the HTTP Basic Authentication Scheme.    token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg  JWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing the JWT used to authenticate the Client at the Token Endpoint for the private_key_jwt and client_secret_jwt authentication methods. All Token Requests using these authentication methods from this Client are rejected, if the JWT is not signed with this algorithm. The value none must not be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP MAY be used.    default_max_age  Default Maximum Authentication Age. Specifies that the End-User must be actively authenticated if the End-User was authenticated longer ago than the specified number of seconds. The max_age request parameter overrides this default value. If omitted, no default Maximum Authentication Age is specified.    require_auth_time  Boolean value specifying whether the auth_time Claim in the ID Token is required. It is required when the value is true. (If this is false, the auth_time Claim can still be dynamically requested as an individual Claim for the ID Token using the claims request parameter) If omitted, the default value is false.    default_acr_values  Default requested Authentication Context Class Reference values. Array of strings that specifies the default acr values that the OP is being requested to use for processing requests from this Client, with the values appearing in order of preference. The Authentication Context Class satisfied by the authentication performed is returned as the acr Claim Value in the issued ID Token. The acr Claim is requested as a Voluntary Claim by this parameter. The acr_values_supported discovery element contains a list of the supported acr values supported by this server. Values specified in the acr_values request parameter or an individual acr Claim request override these default values.    initiate_login_uri  URI using the https scheme that a third party can use to initiate a login by the RP. The URI must accept requests via both GET and POST. The Client must understand the login_hint and iss parameters and should support the target_link_uri parameter.    request_uris  request_uri values that are pre-registered by the RP for use at the OP. The Servers cache the contents of the files referenced by these URIs and not retrieve them at the time they are used in a request. OPs can require that request_uri values used be pre-registered with the require_request_uri_registration discovery parameter. If the contents of the request file could ever change, these URI values should include the base64url encoded SHA-256 hash value of the file contents referenced by the URI as the value of the URI fragment. If the fragment value used for a URI changes, that signals the server that its cached value for that URI with the old fragment value is no longer valid.

It\nperforms a POST on the RPT endpoint, supplying its own AAT in the header\nand a JSON object in the body with a \"ticket\" property containing the\nticket as its value.  If the client had included an RPT in its failed access attempt, It MAY\nalso provide that RPT in an \"rpt\" property in its request to the\nauthorization server.  In circumstances where the client needs to provide requesting party\nclaims to the authorization server, it MAY also include a \"claim_tokens\"\nproperty in its request; see Section 3.4.1.2.1 for more information. The\nauthorization server uses the ticket to look up the details of the\npreviously registered requested permission, maps the requested\npermission to operative resource owner policies based on the resource\nset identifier and scopes associated with it, potentially requests\nadditional information, and ultimately responds positively or negatively\nto the request for authorization data.  The authorization server bases the issuing of authorization data on\nresource owner policies. These policies thus amount to an asynchronous\nOAuth authorization grant. The authorization server is also free to\nenable the resource owner to set policies that require the owner to\ninteract with the server in near-real time to provide consent subsequent\nto an access attempt.

An RPT is associated\nwith a set of authorization data that governs whether the client is\nauthorized for access.   The token's nature and format are dictated by its profile. The profile\nmight allow it to be self-contained, such that the resource server is\nable to determine its status locally, or might require or allow the\nresource server to make a run-time introspection request of the\nauthorization server that issued the token.  The endpoint MAY allow other parameters to provide further context to\nthe query. For instance, an authorization service may need to know the\nIP address of the client accessing the protected resource in order to\ndetermine the appropriateness of the token being presented.  To prevent unauthorized token scanning attacks, the endpoint MUST also\nrequire some form of authorization to access this endpoint, such as\nclient authentication as described in OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] or a separate\nOAuth 2.0 access token such as the bearer token described in OAuth 2.0\nBearer Token Usage [RFC6750].

            "text": "Custom Script / Interception Script\n#\n\n\nGluu Server is very flexible by design enabling the use of \nJython\n interception scripts to customize behaviour. Jython was chosen because an interpreted language facilitates dynamic creation of business logic, and makes it easier to distribute this logic to a cluster of Gluu servers. Another advantage of Jython was that developers can use either Java or Python classes. Combined with the option of calling web services from Python or Java, this enables the Gluu Server to support any business-driven policy requirement.\n\n\nCustom Scripts can be accessed by navigating to Configuration \nand selecting the \nManage Custom Scritps\n tab.\n\n\n\n\nInterception Script Methods\n#\n\n\nThere are three methods that inherit a base interface\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInherited Methods\n\n\nMethod description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndef init(self, configurationAttributes)\n\n\nThis method is only called once during the script initialization. It can be used for global script initialization, initiate objects etc\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndef destroy(self, configurationAttributes)\n\n\nThis method is called once to destroy events. It can be used to free resource and objects created in the \ninit()\n method\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndef getApiVersion(self)\n\n\nThe \ngetApiVersion\n method allows API changes in order to do transparent migration from an old script to a new API. Currently all scripts should return \n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nconfigurationAttributes\n parameter is \njava.util.Map<String, SimpleCustomProperty>\n with properties specified in \noxConfigurationProperty\n attributes.\n\n\nThe script manager only loads enabled scripts. Hence, after enabling a\nscript, the script manager should trigger an event to either load or\ndestroy a script. All scripts are stored in LDAP in the\n\nou=scripts,o=<org_inum>,o=gluu\n branch.\n\n\nThis is a sample entry:\n\n\n    dn: inum=@!1111!031C.4A65,ou=scripts,o=@!1111,o=gluu\n    objectClass: oxCustomScript\n    objectClass: top\n    description: <custom_script_description>\n    displayName: <display_name>\n    gluuStatus: true\n    inum: @!1111!031C.4A65\n    oxLevel: <priority>\n    oxModuleProperty: {\"value1\":\"module_property_name\",\"value2\":\"module_property_value\",\"description\":\"\"}\n    oxConfigurationProperty: {\"value1\":\"configuration_property_name\",\"value2\":\"configuration_property_value\",\"description\":\"\"}\n    oxRevision: <revision>\n    oxScript: <custom_script>\n    oxScriptType: <script_type>\n    programmingLanguage: python\n\n\n\n\nThe script manager reloads scripts automatically without needing to\nrestart the application once \noxRevision\n is increased.\n\n\nInterception Script Logs\n#\n\n\nThe log files regarding interception scripts are not stored in the\n\nwrapper.log\n file. The logs are separated according to the module they\naffect. The oxAuth custom script logs are stored in \noxauth_script.log\n\nand the oxTrust custom script logs are stored in the\n\noxtrust_script.log\n. Please refer to these log files for any errors in\nthe interception scripts or following the workflow of the script.\n\n\nPerson Authentication\n#\n\n\nFor a list of pre-written, open source Gluu authentication scripts, view our \nserver integrations\n\n\nAn authentication script enables you to customize the user\nauthentication experience. For example, you can write a script that\nenables a two-factor authentication mechanism like Duo Security. By\ndefault oxAuth uses simple username/password authentication method. This\nscript type allows an admin to implement more secure workflows to cover\nan organizations security requirements. It extends the base script type\nwith the \ninit\n, \ndestroy\n and \ngetApiVersion\n methods but also adds the\nfollowing methods:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\n\nisValidAuthenticationMethod(self, usageType, configurationAttributes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis method is used to check if the authentication method is in a valid state. For example we can check there if a 3rd party mechanism is available to authenticate users. As a result it should either return \nTrue\n or \nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod Parameter\n\n\nusageType\n is \norg.xdi.model.AuthenticationScriptUsageType\nconfigurationAttributes\n is \njava.util.Map<String, SimpleCustomProperty>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\n\ndef getAlternativeAuthenticationMethod(self, usageType, configurationAttributes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis method is called only if the current authentication method is in an invalid state. Hence authenticator calls it only if \nisValidAuthenticationMethod\n returns False. As a result it should return the reserved authentication method name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod Parameter\n\n\nuageType\n is \norg.xdi.model.AuthenticationScriptUsageType\nconfigurationAttributes\n is \njava.util.Map<String, SimpleCustomProperty>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\n\ndef authenticate(self, configurationAttributes, requestParameters, step)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis method is the key method within the person authentication script. It checks if the user has passed the specified step or not. As a result it should either return \nTrue\n or \nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod Parameter\n\n\nrequestParameters\n is \njava.util.Map<String, String[]>\nstep\n is java integar\nconfigurationAttributes\n is \njava.util.Map<String, SimpleCustomProperty>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\n\ndef prepareForStep(self, configurationAttributes, requestParameters, step)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis method can be used to prepare variables needed to render the login page and store them in an according event context. As a result it should either return \nTrue\n or \nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod Parameter\n\n\nrequestParameters\n is \njava.util.Map<String, String[]>\nstep\n is a java integer\nconfigurationAttributes\n is \njava.util.Map<String, SimpleCustomProperty>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\n\ndef getCountAuthenticationSteps(self, configurationAttributes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis method should return an integer value with the number of steps in the authentication workflow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod Parameter\n\n\nconfigurationAttributes\n is \njava.util.Map<String, SimpleCustomProperty>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\n\ndef getExtraParametersForStep(self, configurationAttributes, step)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis method provides a way to notify the authenticator that it should store specified event context parameters event in the oxAuth session. It is needed in a few cases, for example when an authentication script redirects the user to a 3rd party authentication system and expects the workflow to resume after that.

The hostname and the IP address is used in many settings stored in LDAP configuration entries, Apache/Jetty configuration and into the custom authentication script. It is strongly recommended to use a fresh install in a new VM. \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPlease use static IP address with reverse proxy or load balancer or simple port forwarding.\n\n\n\n\nHow to set the port to something other than 443\n#\n\n\nPorts other than 443 are not supported as the port is used by Apache Web Server. In theory, the change must reflect in the SAML and OpenID Connect metadata and still there might be errors.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPlease use a virtual ethernet interface and a different IP address on your server\n\n\n\n\nHow to customize IDP to ask for Email instead of username\n#\n\n\nIn oxTrust navigate to the Manage Authentication tab within the Configuration section. By default the Primary Key and Local Key are set to \nuid\n. Set those va    lues to \nmail\n and now your Gluu Server will expect email as the identifier instead of username.\n\n\n\n\nNow you will want to update your IDP login page to display \nEmail Address\n as the requested identifier. In order to do that you need to modify the \nlogin.xhtm    l\n file, which is located in \n/opt/tomcat/webapps/oxauth/\n. Insert \nEmail Address\n as the value for \noutputLabel\n; this snippet is under the \ndialog\n class. S    ee the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\nHow to add additional roles to oxTrust and change permissions for existing ones\n#\n\n\nThe additional role requires the implementation of dynamic rules in Jboss SEAM and then uitlize them in oxTrust as the available \nmanager\n and \nuser\n roles are defined within the \nsecurit.drl\n hard-coded into oxTrust. The file checks for the \nmaanger\n group membership and adds the role to the web context. This is currently out of the scope of support. \n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\noxTrust is a tool for administrators and it must nto be used as a user facing application.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting Guide\n#\n\n\nAdd admin for Gluu server\n#\n\n\nPlease follow these steps to restore your Gluu admin account (you will\nprobably need to substitute actual port, bind names and hostnames with\nones used by your installation):\n\n\n1) Login into Gluu's chroot environment with the command below:\n\n\n# service gluu-server login\n\n\n\n\n2) Run this command:\n\n\n#/opt/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -p 1636 -Z -X -D 'cn=directory manager' -w 'YOUR_BIND_PASSWORD' -b o=gluu gluuGroupType=gluuManagerGroup 1.1\n\n\n\n\nand remember the displayed dn of the Gluu Manager Group for future use.\n\n\n3) Run this command:\n\n\n# /opt/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -p 1636 -Z -X -D 'cn=directory manager' -w 'YOUR_BIND_PASSWORD' -b o=gluu ou=people 1.1\n\n\n\n\nand remember the displayed dn of the People ou for future use.\n\n\n4) While staying in the chrooted environment, create the file\n\n~/add_user.ldif\n using your favorite text editor, and copy the\nfollowing lines to it:\n\n\ndn: inum=tempadmin,ou=people,o=@!F9CC.D762.4778.1032!0001!2C72.BB87,o=gluu\nchangetype: add\nuid: tempadmin\nobjectClass: gluuPerson\nobjectClass: top\ngivenName: tempadmin\nsn: tempadmin\ninum: tempadmin\ngluuStatus: active\nuserPassword: 1q2w3e\n\n\n\n\nPlease note the string's segment marked with bold: you will have to\nsubstitute it with dn of your own People ou which you've acquired in\nstep 3).\n\n\n5) Run this command:\n\n\n# /opt/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -p 1636 -Z -X -D 'cn=directory manager' -w 'YOUR_BIND_PASSWORD' -f ~/add_user.ldif\n\n\n\n\nThis will create new user tempadmin with attributes provided via file\ncreated in step 4).\n\n\n6) Now create file \nadd_2_group.ldif\n in your home (\"~/\") directory and\ncopy the following lines to it:\n\n\ndn: inum=@!F9CC.D762.4778.1032!0001!2C72.BB87!0003!60B7,ou=groups,o=@!f9cc.d762.4778.1032!0001!2c72.bb87,o=gluu\nchangetype: modify\nadd: member\nmember: inum=tempadmin,ou=people,o=@!f9cc.d762.4778.1032!0001!2c72.bb87,o=gluu\n\n\n\n\nAgain, please note the strings' segment marked with bold: you will have\nto substitute contents of the \"dn:\" string with dn of your own Gluu\nManager Group which you've acquired in step 2), and for \"member:\" string\nyou will have to use the dn of tempadmin user (the one you already\nspecified in the 1st line of the file in step 4).\n\n\n7) Run this command:\n\n\n# /opt/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -p 1636 -Z -X -D 'cn=directory manager' -w 'YOUR_BIND_PASSWORD' -f ~/add_2_group.ldif\n\n\n\n\nThis will add tempadmin user to the IdP managers group and you can then\nlogin and assign another user to act as admin.\n\n\nConnectivity Issues?\n#\n\n\nDNS names not resolving!\n#\n\n\nIt is possible that even after configuring everything there is a \nDNS\n resolve error in Gluu Server.\nThe reason is the \nDNS\n used inside the chroot container; the \ndns\n used by the container is the Google DNS servers \nand the \nDNS\n for the host OS is not used. Therefore to fix this issue:\n\n\n\n\nChange the DNS inside the container by editing the \n/etc/resolv.conf\n file and adding the DNS used by your organization\n\n\n\n\nForgot the admin password!\n#\n\n\nGluu Server stores the admin password in the file \n/install/community-edition-setup/setup.properties.last\n under the\nproperty \nldapPass\n. Retrieve the data using the following command:\n\n\n# grep ldapPass= /install/community-edition-setup/*.last\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIt is strongly recommended to remove the file from any production environment or encrypt the file\n\n\n\n\nRevert Authentication Method\n#\n\n\nIt is not unlikely that you will lock yourself out of Gluu Server while testing the authentication script, if there is any problem in it. In such a case the following method can be used to revert back the older authentication method.\n\n\n\n\nRun the following command to collect the \ninum\n for the Gluu Server installation.\n\n\n\n\n/opt/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1389 -D \"cn=directory \nmanager\" -j ~/.pw -b \"ou=appliances,o=gluu\" -s one \"objectclass=*\" \noxAuthenticationMode\n\n\n\n\nCreate a \nLDIF\n file with the contents below:\n\n\n\n\ndn: inum=@!1E3B.F133.14FA.5062!0002!4B66.CF9C,ou=appliances,o=gluu\nchangetype: modify\nreplace: oxAuthenticationMode\noxAuthenticationMode: internal\n\n\n\n\nAs an example, we shall call this file \nchangeAuth.ldif\n.\n\n\nNote:\n Replace the \ninum\n from the example above with the \ninum\n of the Gluu Server from the \nldapsearch\n command.\n\n\n\n\nReplace the the authentication mode using \nldapmodify\n command.\n\n\n\n\n`/opt/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -p 1636 -Z -X -D 'cn=directory manager' -w 'YOUR_BIND_PASSWORD' -f ~/changeAuth.ldif\n\n\nNo admin access after Cache Refresh?\n#\n\n\nAdd the password for your admin account to \n~/.pw\n and then use the commands below to add yourself as an admin.\n\n\n# set this to your actual user name\nexport newgluuadmin='myusername'\n\n# this is the file that will hold the info to be imported\nexport ldiffile='addManagers.ldif'\n\n# run this and verify that the output is for your account\n/opt/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1636 -D \"cn=directory manager\" -j ~/.pw -Z -X -b \"o=gluu\" \"uid=$newgluuadmin\" uid givenName sn cn\n\ndn: inum=@!134D.3C3D.796E.FECE!0001!E022.CC3C!0000!A8F2.DE1E.D7FB,ou=people,o=@!134D.\n 3C3D.796E.FECE!0001!E022.CC3C,o=gluu\nuid: myusername\ngivenName: John\nsn: Doe\ncn: John Doe\n\n\n\n\nNow you can run these commands to make the file above:\n\n\nhead -n1 /opt/opendj/ldif/groups.ldif > $ldiffile\necho 'changetype: modify' >> $ldiffile\necho 'add: member' >> $ldiffile\necho \"member: $(/opt/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1636 -D \"cn=directory manager\" -j ~/.pw -Z -X -b \"o=gluu\" \"uid=$newgluuadmin\" uid givenName sn cn |grep -A1 dn |cut -d ' ' -f 2- | sed 'N;s/\\n//')\" >> $ldiffile\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting ldif will look like this:\n\n\ndn: inum=@!134D.3C3D.796E.FECE!0001!E022.CC3C!0003!60B7,ou=groups,o=@!134D.3C3D.796E.FECE!0001!E022.CC3C,o=gluu\nchangetype: modify\nadd: member\nmember: inum=@!134D.3C3D.796E.FECE!0001!E022.CC3C!0000!A8F2.DE1E.D7FB,ou=people,o=@!134D.3C3D.796E.FECE!0001!E022.CC3C,o=gluu\n\n\n\n\nOnce the ldif looks right, run this to grant your account admin rights in Gluu:\n\n\n/opt/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -h localhost -p 1636 -D \"cn=directory manager\" -j ~/.pw -Z -X -f addManagers.ldif\n\n\n\n\nLog into the web interface and pick up where you left off :)",

How to change the hostname/IP address/listening port of Gluu Server #  It is not recommended to change the hostname or IP address or the listening port of any installed Gluu Server instance. The hostname and the IP address is used in many settings stored in LDAP configuration entries, Apache/Jetty configuration and into the custom authentication script. It is strongly recommended to use a fresh install in a new VM.    Note  Please use static IP address with reverse proxy or load balancer or simple port forwarding.   How to set the port to something other than 443 #  Ports other than 443 are not supported as the port is used by Apache Web Server. In theory, the change must reflect in the SAML and OpenID Connect metadata and still there might be errors.   Note  Please use a virtual ethernet interface and a different IP address on your server   How to customize IDP to ask for Email instead of username #  In oxTrust navigate to the Manage Authentication tab within the Configuration section. By default the Primary Key and Local Key are set to  uid . Set those va    lues to  mail  and now your Gluu Server will expect email as the identifier instead of username.   Now you will want to update your IDP login page to display  Email Address  as the requested identifier. In order to do that you need to modify the  login.xhtm    l  file, which is located in  /opt/tomcat/webapps/oxauth/ . Insert  Email Address  as the value for  outputLabel ; this snippet is under the  dialog  class. S    ee the screenshot below.   How to add additional roles to oxTrust and change permissions for existing ones #  The additional role requires the implementation of dynamic rules in Jboss SEAM and then uitlize them in oxTrust as the available  manager  and  user  roles are defined within the  securit.drl  hard-coded into oxTrust. The file checks for the  maanger  group membership and adds the role to the web context. This is currently out of the scope of support.    Warning  oxTrust is a tool for administrators and it must nto be used as a user facing application.",

            "text": "Add admin for Gluu server #  Please follow these steps to restore your Gluu admin account (you will\nprobably need to substitute actual port, bind names and hostnames with\nones used by your installation):  1) Login into Gluu's chroot environment with the command below:  # service gluu-server login  2) Run this command:  #/opt/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -p 1636 -Z -X -D 'cn=directory manager' -w 'YOUR_BIND_PASSWORD' -b o=gluu gluuGroupType=gluuManagerGroup 1.1  and remember the displayed dn of the Gluu Manager Group for future use.  3) Run this command:  # /opt/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -p 1636 -Z -X -D 'cn=directory manager' -w 'YOUR_BIND_PASSWORD' -b o=gluu ou=people 1.1  and remember the displayed dn of the People ou for future use.  4) While staying in the chrooted environment, create the file ~/add_user.ldif  using your favorite text editor, and copy the\nfollowing lines to it:  dn: inum=tempadmin,ou=people,o=@!F9CC.D762.4778.1032!0001!2C72.BB87,o=gluu\nchangetype: add\nuid: tempadmin\nobjectClass: gluuPerson\nobjectClass: top\ngivenName: tempadmin\nsn: tempadmin\ninum: tempadmin\ngluuStatus: active\nuserPassword: 1q2w3e  Please note the string's segment marked with bold: you will have to\nsubstitute it with dn of your own People ou which you've acquired in\nstep 3).  5) Run this command:  # /opt/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -p 1636 -Z -X -D 'cn=directory manager' -w 'YOUR_BIND_PASSWORD' -f ~/add_user.ldif  This will create new user tempadmin with attributes provided via file\ncreated in step 4).  6) Now create file  add_2_group.ldif  in your home (\"~/\") directory and\ncopy the following lines to it:  dn: inum=@!F9CC.D762.4778.1032!0001!2C72.BB87!0003!60B7,ou=groups,o=@!f9cc.d762.4778.1032!0001!2c72.bb87,o=gluu\nchangetype: modify\nadd: member\nmember: inum=tempadmin,ou=people,o=@!f9cc.d762.4778.1032!0001!2c72.bb87,o=gluu  Again, please note the strings' segment marked with bold: you will have\nto substitute contents of the \"dn:\" string with dn of your own Gluu\nManager Group which you've acquired in step 2), and for \"member:\" string\nyou will have to use the dn of tempadmin user (the one you already\nspecified in the 1st line of the file in step 4).  7) Run this command:  # /opt/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -p 1636 -Z -X -D 'cn=directory manager' -w 'YOUR_BIND_PASSWORD' -f ~/add_2_group.ldif  This will add tempadmin user to the IdP managers group and you can then\nlogin and assign another user to act as admin.  Connectivity Issues? #  DNS names not resolving! #  It is possible that even after configuring everything there is a  DNS  resolve error in Gluu Server.\nThe reason is the  DNS  used inside the chroot container; the  dns  used by the container is the Google DNS servers \nand the  DNS  for the host OS is not used. Therefore to fix this issue:   Change the DNS inside the container by editing the  /etc/resolv.conf  file and adding the DNS used by your organization   Forgot the admin password! #  Gluu Server stores the admin password in the file  /install/community-edition-setup/setup.properties.last  under the\nproperty  ldapPass . Retrieve the data using the following command:  # grep ldapPass= /install/community-edition-setup/*.last   Warning  It is strongly recommended to remove the file from any production environment or encrypt the file   Revert Authentication Method #  It is not unlikely that you will lock yourself out of Gluu Server while testing the authentication script, if there is any problem in it. In such a case the following method can be used to revert back the older authentication method.   Run the following command to collect the  inum  for the Gluu Server installation.   /opt/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1389 -D \"cn=directory \nmanager\" -j ~/.pw -b \"ou=appliances,o=gluu\" -s one \"objectclass=*\" \noxAuthenticationMode   Create a  LDIF  file with the contents below:   dn: inum=@!1E3B.F133.14FA.5062!0002!4B66.CF9C,ou=appliances,o=gluu\nchangetype: modify\nreplace: oxAuthenticationMode\noxAuthenticationMode: internal  As an example, we shall call this file  changeAuth.ldif .  Note:  Replace the  inum  from the example above with the  inum  of the Gluu Server from the  ldapsearch  command.   Replace the the authentication mode using  ldapmodify  command.   `/opt/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -p 1636 -Z -X -D 'cn=directory manager' -w 'YOUR_BIND_PASSWORD' -f ~/changeAuth.ldif  No admin access after Cache Refresh? #  Add the password for your admin account to  ~/.pw  and then use the commands below to add yourself as an admin.  # set this to your actual user name\nexport newgluuadmin='myusername'\n\n# this is the file that will hold the info to be imported\nexport ldiffile='addManagers.ldif'\n\n# run this and verify that the output is for your account\n/opt/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1636 -D \"cn=directory manager\" -j ~/.pw -Z -X -b \"o=gluu\" \"uid=$newgluuadmin\" uid givenName sn cn\n\ndn: inum=@!134D.3C3D.796E.FECE!0001!E022.CC3C!0000!A8F2.DE1E.D7FB,ou=people,o=@!134D.\n 3C3D.796E.FECE!0001!E022.CC3C,o=gluu\nuid: myusername\ngivenName: John\nsn: Doe\ncn: John Doe  Now you can run these commands to make the file above:  head -n1 /opt/opendj/ldif/groups.ldif > $ldiffile\necho 'changetype: modify' >> $ldiffile\necho 'add: member' >> $ldiffile\necho \"member: $(/opt/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1636 -D \"cn=directory manager\" -j ~/.pw -Z -X -b \"o=gluu\" \"uid=$newgluuadmin\" uid givenName sn cn |grep -A1 dn |cut -d ' ' -f 2- | sed 'N;s/\\n//')\" >> $ldiffile  The resulting ldif will look like this:  dn: inum=@!134D.3C3D.796E.FECE!0001!E022.CC3C!0003!60B7,ou=groups,o=@!134D.3C3D.796E.FECE!0001!E022.CC3C,o=gluu\nchangetype: modify\nadd: member\nmember: inum=@!134D.3C3D.796E.FECE!0001!E022.CC3C!0000!A8F2.DE1E.D7FB,ou=people,o=@!134D.3C3D.796E.FECE!0001!E022.CC3C,o=gluu  Once the ldif looks right, run this to grant your account admin rights in Gluu:  /opt/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -h localhost -p 1636 -D \"cn=directory manager\" -j ~/.pw -Z -X -f addManagers.ldif  Log into the web interface and pick up where you left off :)",
